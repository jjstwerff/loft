# One line per file: `<n> <file>` — the LAST census line of the run, which is the whole
# program; the earlier ones are the stdlib loads, each checked on its own.; a final `TOTAL nested=<n> files=<m> failed=<k>`.
# A file the compiler refuses (an @EXPECT_ERROR guard, a missing library) is counted as
# `failed` and contributes nothing — the census only reads programs that reached
# `scopes::check`, so a refused file is neither a 0 nor a finding.
