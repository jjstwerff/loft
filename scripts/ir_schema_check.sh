# Is `src/ir_schema_gen.rs` still a faithful regeneration of `tools/ir_schema/ir.loft`?
#
# That file is `@generated … DO NOT EDIT — regenerate`, and the store LAYOUT is derived
# from it: record sizes, field byte offsets, the `Node` discriminants that
# `data_store.rs`'s baked `DISC_*` constants mirror.  Nothing gated the two staying in
# step, and they did not: `Key` gained a third field (`start`) in loft#812, the generated
# file was updated to match, `ir.loft` — the SOURCE — was not, and nobody regenerated for
# months.  The next regeneration silently DROPPED `Key.start` and took `KEY_STRIDE` from
# 24 to 16.  A wrong store layout is not a build error; it is a wrong byte offset.
#
# The check is the pipeline run for real, then a byte compare:
#
#   ir.loft --(loft --introspect --show-rust)--> generated.rs --(extract.py)--> compare
#
# `extract.py` emits a single trailing newline precisely so a fresh regeneration is
# byte-identical to the committed file, which is what makes the compare meaningful.
#
# Costs ~0.1 s.  Exits 0 when they agree, 1 when they drift, and 0 with a SKIP line when
# the inputs to run it are not present (see below).
#
# ⚠ It needs a BUILT loft to regenerate with, which is circular in the sense that the
# binary is compiled from the file being checked — but not viciously: whatever state
# `ir_schema_gen.rs` is in, the binary built from it still parses `ir.loft` the same way,
# so a hand-edit shows up as a diff and an un-regenerated `ir.loft` edit shows up as one
# too.  When no binary exists the check SKIPS rather than failing, so a fresh clone is not
# blocked; `make ci` builds one, so there it always runs.
#
# Usage:  scripts/ir_schema_check.sh [--fix]
#           --fix   write the regenerated file over src/ir_schema_gen.rs
