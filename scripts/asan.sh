# Run the AddressSanitizer suite locally in an ISOLATED target dir.
#
# WHY: ASan needs a nightly toolchain (`-Zsanitizer=address`).  A nightly build
# run into the shared `target/` compiles `libloft_ffi` (and everything else) with
# nightly rustc; a later STABLE build/test then hits E0514 ("incompatible version
# of rustc") because the native test harness links that rlib directly and its
# mtime looks fresh — neither cargo nor mtime rebuilds it.  Keeping nightly
# artifacts in `target/asan/` means the stable `target/` is never polluted, so
# `find_problems.sh` / native tests always reuse clean stable artifacts.  (CI's
# `asan` job in .github/workflows/miri.yml is safe already — it runs on a fresh,
# separately-cached checkout; this wrapper gives local runs the same isolation.)
#
# Mirrors that CI job's flags.  Extra args pass through to nextest, e.g.
#   ./scripts/asan.sh -E 'test(store_)'
#
# Two of those flags are load-bearing, and running without them fails in ways that
# look like a code problem but are not:
#
#   --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
#       Scopes RUSTFLAGS to the TARGET, so host proc-macros and build scripts stay
#       uninstrumented.  Without it, `-Zsanitizer=address` is applied to the
#       proc-macro crates too and the build dies in a dependency with
#       `E0463: can't find crate for zerofrom_derive`.
#
#   +$TOOLCHAIN (pinned)
#       A bare `+nightly` follows whatever nightly is installed; a recent one fails
#       to compile `curve25519-dalek` (avx512 backend).  CI pins this exact nightly
#       (ci.yml, the `asan` job) — track it here or local runs diverge from CI.
#       Override with ASAN_TOOLCHAIN=... when CI's pin moves.
#
# WHAT THIS GATE ACTUALLY COVERS.  loft's Store is ONE arena allocation, and ASan
# checks allocation bounds — so a read past a RECORD but still inside the arena is
# invisible here (measured, not assumed).  ASan catches WILD offsets that leave the
# arena.  For intra-arena bounds use `-C debug-assertions=on`, which turns on
# `Store::valid()` (CI's `debug-asserts` job); loft's ~200 `debug_assert!`s are
# compiled out of normal builds by `[profile.dev.package.loft]`.
#
# If a stray nightly build already polluted `target/`, find_problems.sh's
# ffi_toolchain_guard self-heals the stale rlib on its next run.
