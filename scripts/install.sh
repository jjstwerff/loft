# install.sh — get a working loft onto this machine, for someone who will not build it.
#
# @PLN78 step 6.  Deliberately the least clever piece of the distribution chain, and
# that is the design rather than a shortcut.  A shell script cannot verify a signed
# registry index, so instead of teaching it to try, its job is made small enough to
# audit in one sitting: pick the artifact for this host, check one sha256, unpack it,
# and hand off to loft, which verifies itself properly (`loft verify-self`).  Everything
# this script is trusted for is on this page.
#
# What the sha256 check does and does not prove: it catches a truncated or corrupted
# download, and it detects an artifact that does not match what the release recorded.
# It is not a signature — this script and the artifact arrive over the same transport,
# so anyone who could substitute one could substitute the other.  Real authenticity
# comes from the signed registry index, which the installed binary checks.
#
# Usage:
#   curl -fsSL <url>/install.sh | sh              # latest release, into ~/.local
#   sh install.sh --prefix /usr/local             # somewhere else
#   sh install.sh --version 2026.7.2              # a specific release
#   sh install.sh --list                          # what would be installed, no changes
#
# Prefer to read before running (the script is short on purpose):
#   curl -fsSLO <url>/install.sh && less install.sh && sh install.sh
