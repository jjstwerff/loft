"""Vacuity sweep — can each script test actually FAIL?

Flips the FIRST `assert` in every `tests/scripts/*.loft` to `false` and checks the file
then fails WITH an assertion failure.  A file that still passes never executed that
assert, so it is a guard that guards nothing.  A REPORT, never a gate.

Two things it taught, both worth keeping in mind before trusting a run:

  * Run each file the way the HARNESS runs it.  A script with no `main` uses `fn test_*`
    entry points, and `--interpret` executes nothing at all in it — the first sweep
    flagged 166 files, 164 of which simply had no `main`.  With `--tests` for those, the
    real number was 9.
  * `assert(` inside a COMMENT is not code.  Two more of the nine were the mutation
    editing prose.

Of the genuine survivors, the interesting ones were `par` tests: a runtime fault inside a
`parallel` arm is silently discarded (loft#1053), so an in-arm assertion can never fail a
run.  That is what this sweep is for — it finds guards that cannot fail, which no green
suite will ever report.
