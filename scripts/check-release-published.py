"""Refuse to start a new version while the previous release never reached the registry.

@PLN78.  Publishing a release is two halves: GitHub gets the binaries, and the signed
registry index gets the entry that makes them findable and verifiable.  Only the first
half fails loudly.  If the registry PR is forgotten, or its CI stays red, or it is
merged without a re-sign, everything keeps working -- `loft self-update` simply reports
"no releases published to compare against" forever, and `loft verify-self` can only say
a bundle is intact.  Nobody is paged by a feature quietly not existing; the usual way it
surfaces is a user asking why an update never arrived.

So the drift is caught at the one moment it is cheap to fix and expensive to skip: the
release-prep PR that bumps `Cargo.toml`.  Shipping N+1 while N never reached the
registry is how a gap becomes permanent -- N's assets are frozen at publish, so a
release that missed its entry can often never get a correct one afterwards.

**Only that PR is gated.**  A check that went red on every PR for the window between
"publish" and "registry PR merged" would be red for hours after each release, across
work that has nothing to do with it -- which teaches everyone to merge past a red
check, the opposite of what a gate is for.

Exits 0 when there is nothing to gate or the previous release is complete; 1 with a
GitHub-annotated error otherwise.
