#
#   scripts/par_gates.sh          # local (also `make par-gates`)
#   scripts/par_gates.sh --ci     # CI: a SKIPPED gate is a FAILURE
#
# Why --ci exists.  Every gate exits 0 when a prerequisite is missing (no
# threaded bundle, no chromium, no nightly), so a dev without them still gets a
# useful run.  On the runner all of them are installed, so "skipped" can only
# mean the provisioning broke — and a gate that skips itself green is exactly
# the silent rot this suite is here to prevent.  --ci therefore preflights the
# prerequisites, fails on any SKIP, and writes a per-gate table to the job
# summary so the scaling curve stays on the record.
#
# The gates: dispatch + fallback + nested par (par-thread-proof), the
# shared-memory model (par-memory-proof), scaling (par-scaling-bench), UI
# responsiveness (par-ui-responsive), and the `loft --html` bundle
# (html-thread-proof).  The last two read thresholds from the environment
# because runner hardware is smaller than this dev box; the workflow
# .github/workflows/browser-threads.yml sets them.
