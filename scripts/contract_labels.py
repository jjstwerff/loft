"""Read `Contract:` trailers off fix commits and apply the `contract:` labels.

The `contract:` axis (.github/LABELS.md) records whether closing a bug had to MOVE the
written standard.  It is set at FIX time, because that is the only moment the answer
exists — it is what the fix turned out to need, not something the filer could know.

Three places read the same trailer, in the order a fix meets them:

* `.githooks/commit-msg` asks for it while you are typing the message;
* the **push workflow** (`.github/workflows/apply-fixed-pending-merge.yml`) applies the
  label the moment the fix is pushed — the same event, and the same commit list, that
  labels the issue `fixed-pending-merge`, so the two verdicts a fix carries land
  together;
* a hand run here is the BACKSTOP for whatever gets through both: `--report` names every
  `Fixes #N` commit on the branch whose trailer is missing, so a miss is recoverable
  later instead of becoming a permanently unjudged issue.

That backstop is the point — `Fixes #N` itself was in CLAUDE.md, ISSUE_TRACKING.md and two
skills before a hook existed, and fixes still shipped without it; prose alone did not make
it stick, and neither will this.

Usage:
    scripts/contract_labels.py                     # report what the branch says (dry run)
    scripts/contract_labels.py --apply             # label the issues on GitHub
    scripts/contract_labels.py --base origin/main  # commits since this ref (default)
    scripts/contract_labels.py --report            # ONLY the unjudged fixes, for a nudge
    scripts/contract_labels.py --event "$GITHUB_EVENT_PATH"   # a push payload, not git
    scripts/contract_labels.py --self-test         # the parse, against a fixed corpus
