// @PLN117 — loft's own browser thread pool (no wasm-bindgen)

//! loft's browser thread pool: `par` on real Web Worker threads.
//!
//! rayon does the scheduling, exactly as on the native backend, so `par` and
//! `par_fold` behave the same everywhere.  Only the part rayon cannot do itself
//! is loft's: a browser has no `thread::spawn`, so the pool's threads arrive
//! from the outside.  The host (`doc/loft-thread.js`) spawns N Web Workers, each
//! instantiating the SAME module against the SAME shared memory, and each calls
//! [`loft_rayon_start_worker`] to collect one of the `ThreadBuilder`s that
//! [`loft_pool_build`] parked here.
//!
//! ## Why start-up is two calls and not one
//!
//! Spawning a Worker is asynchronous, and installing the pool waits for every
//! worker to prime.  Doing both inside one wasm call therefore deadlocks: the
//! main thread waits for workers that cannot finish booting until it returns to
//! the event loop (measured — @PLN117 amendment A2).  So the host calls
//! [`loft_pool_new`], awaits each worker's *ready* message, and only then calls
//! [`loft_pool_build`].
//!
//! Because the host has to sequence start-up anyway, it also does the spawning:
//! [`loft_pool_new`] hands back the handoff pointer and the host takes it from
//! there.  Nothing here calls out to JS, so this runtime needs no host import of
//! its own — which is what lets the SAME pool serve both the raw `--html`
//! bundle and the wasm-bindgen gallery one, whose glue builds its imports itself
//! and would reject an extra module.
//!
//! ## What the host must do per worker
//!
//! Every `WebAssembly.Instance` gets its own copy of the mutable globals, but
//! they all start at the SAME values — so a worker that runs any wasm before
//! being moved off the main thread's shadow stack corrupts it.  The host
//! allocates each worker a stack and a TLS block with [`loft_thread_alloc`],
//! sets that instance's `__stack_pointer`, and calls `__wasm_init_tls` before
//! anything else.  wasm-bindgen's thread transform does this internally; the raw
//! path does it from JS, which is why the build exports `__stack_pointer`.
//!
//! Not initialising the pool at all is a supported state: rayon falls back to a
//! single-threaded pool, so `par` runs sequentially and still returns the same
//! values (arc D — proven never to break).
