//! `LOFT_VERIFY_STACK=1` — read a stack slot that no path wrote, and hear about it.
//!
//! @PLN154 phase 1.  The interpreter's frame is a raw byte store: nothing beside the
//! bytes says whether a slot holds a value at all.  A path that yields nothing therefore
//! leaves the consumer reading whatever the slot held before, and the program answers a
//! plausible number nobody computed — loft#1386 is the measured case, where a
//! value-position `match` arm that produced no value made the whole expression answer
//! `null`, silently, on both backends.
//!
//! The shadow is one tag byte per stack byte, carried by the stack [`Store`] itself
//! (`init_shadow`), so it grows and moves with the buffer it describes rather than being
//! kept in step by hand:
//!
//! * a write through [`Store::addr_mut`](crate::store::Store::addr_mut) TAGS the bytes it
//!   covers — phase 0 measured that 32 of the 33 sites that write the stack reach it
//!   there, where only 74.5 % of the bytes arrive through the typed accessor;
//! * a byte-for-byte move ([`Stores::copy_block`](crate::database::Stores::copy_block) and
//!   friends) carries the tags with the bytes, so a returned value stays as written — or
//!   as unwritten — as the callee left it;
//! * a slot that leaves the live frame loses its tag, because the next occupant of that
//!   offset inherits nothing from the last;
//! * and a read at [`State::get_stack`](crate::state::State::get_stack) /
//!   [`get_var`](crate::state::State::get_var) reports an untagged span.
//!
//! **Tag low, check high** — the low-level reader `Store::addr` is deliberately NOT
//! checked, because the debugger, the frame renderer and the anomaly scanner read
//! uninitialised slots for a living and a check there would report the diagnostics as
//! defects.
//!
//! Off by default and off in every release path: when the shadow is not armed the whole
//! mechanism is one length load and a not-taken branch per store write.
