// @I67 — Opcode implementations

//! `LOFT_STACK_CENSUS=1` — which code actually writes the interpreter stack?
//!
//! @PLN154 phase 0.  The plan's shadow keys its tag on the two typed accessors,
//! [`State::put_stack`](crate::state::State::put_stack) and
//! [`State::get_stack`](crate::state::State::get_stack).  That is sound only if those
//! accessors are where the bytes actually arrive, and the repo already knows of one
//! route that goes around them: the return-value slide in
//! `State::return_value` is a raw `copy_block`, which `LOFT_UAF_GEN` had to be taught
//! by hand after an untracked slide produced its residual false positive.  A shadow
//! built on an incomplete list of writers reports the language's own code as a defect.
//!
//! So this measures the question instead of assuming an answer, and it takes no list of
//! sites on trust.  After every operator it **diffs** the stack store's live bytes
//! against a snapshot, subtracts the spans `put_stack` says it wrote, and attributes
//! what is left to the opcode that ran.  A route nobody knows about is therefore
//! counted, because the ground truth is the memory rather than an inventory of callers.
//!
//! Two numbers come out: the share of stack bytes that arrive through `put_stack`, and
//! the opcodes responsible for the rest.  The second is the actionable one — each
//! opcode names an implementation in `fill.rs` or `state/`, which is the site list the
//! phase owes.
//!
//! Off by default and off in every release path: one `OnceLock` read per op when armed,
//! nothing when not.
