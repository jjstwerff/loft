// @PLN129 arc B — deriving the query from the store's own schema.

// The plan is named for this: a lookup that misses fetches exactly that record,
// from a query nobody wrote. The descriptor carries the type name, the field
// names and offsets, and — because loft's collection KINDS are query shapes —
// which fields are the key and in which direction they are ordered. That is a
// SELECT, and nothing here is enumerated ahead of time.
//
// Pure and unwired by design: it reads a `LayoutDesc` and returns a string, so
// it is testable with no database, no connection and no store.
