//! @PLN115 — the parse-time resolution index (position → resolved binding).
//!
//! The parser records, during parse, what each identifier occurrence resolves to,
//! so tooling (loft-lsp) can answer "what is the symbol at (line, col)?" and "where
//! are all occurrences of THIS binding?" PRECISELY, not lexically by name.  Gated
//! by `Parser.record_resolutions` (default off, zero-cost) — see
//! `doc/claude/plans/115-resolution-index/design.md`.
//!
//! S1 (this): the model, inert — nothing records yet.  S2 wires the first hook.

/// One resolved identifier occurrence recorded during parse.  `(line, col)` are
/// 1-based (the parser's own position convention); `len` is the name's char count,
/// so a consumer has the full `[col, col+len)` reference span without re-deriving it.
