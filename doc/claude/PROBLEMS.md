## Unimplemented Features

### 22. Spatial index operations are not implemented

**Pre-gate fix (2026-03-15):** `spacial<T>` in any field or variable type now emits a
compile-time error:
```
spacial<T> is not yet implemented; use sorted<T> or index<T> for ordered lookups
```
Both first-pass and second-pass are covered; no program can reach the runtime `Not implemented`
panics via `spacial<T>` anymore.  Test: `spacial_not_implemented` in `tests/parse_errors.rs`.

**Remaining work:** The full implementation (insert, lookup, copy, remove, iteration) is still
missing.  Best way forward: implement one operation at a time in `database.rs` and `fill.rs`,
starting with iteration, then remove, then copy.  The spacial index structure (radix tree or
R-tree) is already allocated in the schema; the iteration traversal is the main missing piece.

## Stack Slot Assignment (In Progress)

### 24. Full compile-time slot assignment not yet implemented

**Current:** Stack slot positions are determined at codegen time by `claim()` in
`state.rs`. The final two steps of the planned P2 pass are missing:
- `assign_slots()` — compute optimal positions using precomputed live intervals
- Remove `claim()` calls and `copy_variable()` once the above is done

**Impact:** Non-optimal stack usage; potential conflicts detected by `validate_slots`
in debug builds.

**Best way forward:** Implement `assign_slots()` in `variables.rs` as a greedy
interval-graph colouring: sort variables by `first_def`, assign each to the lowest
slot position not occupied by a live variable of incompatible type. Wire it into
`scopes::check` after `compute_intervals`. Once all tests pass with `assign_slots`,
remove `claim()` from `state.rs`.

**Details:** [ASSIGNMENT.md](ASSIGNMENT.md) §"P2 — Full slot assignment pass".

## Parser / Compiler Bugs

### 44. Empty vector literal `[]` cannot be passed directly as a mutable vector argument

**Symptom:** Passing `[]` directly as a function argument where the parameter is a mutable
vector (`vector<T>`) fails at compile time or produces incorrect codegen:
```loft
assert(join([], "-") == "", ...);  // ← fails
```
In a debug build, the `generate_call` debug assertion fires:
```
mutable arg 0 (parts: Vector(...)) expected 12B on stack but generate(Insert([Null])) pushed 0B
```

**Root cause:** `parse_vector` in `expressions.rs` returns early with `Value::Insert([Null])`
for an empty `[]` literal when the target is not an existing variable (`is_var = false`).  This
path is reached when `[]` appears as a function call argument, because expression parsing uses
`Type::Unknown(0)` as the initial type context.  With an unknown element type, no temporary
variable is created and no `vector_db` initialisation ops are emitted.  The `Value::Insert([Null])`
carries no stack presence, so the mutable-arg handler finds 0 bytes instead of the 12-byte
`DbRef` it expects.

By contrast, `my_vec = []` in an assignment statement works: on the second pass `my_vec` already
has an inferred type, and `create_vector` (called from `parse_assign_op`) inserts the correct
`vector_db` initialisation ops into the Insert.

**Workaround:** Assign the empty vector to a named variable first; the type is then inferred
from the subsequent call, and the second pass initialises the variable correctly:
```loft
join_empty = [];
assert(join(join_empty, "-") == "", ...);
```

**Fix path:** In `parse_vector`, when the early-return `else` branch is taken (empty `[]`,
not a Var, not a field), create a unique temporary variable, call `vector_db` to initialise it,
push `Value::Var(vec)` as the block result, and wrap in `v_block` — matching what the non-empty
path does when `block = true`.  The difficulty is that `assign_tp` (the element type) is
`Type::Unknown(0)` at this point; `vector_db` must either tolerate Unknown gracefully on the
second pass or this path must be deferred until the call-site type is known.

**Effort:** Medium (parser change; requires careful handling of the Unknown element type)

## Web Services Design Constraints

### 54. `json_items` returns opaque `vector<text>` — no compile-time element type
**Severity:** Low — accepted design limitation
**Description:** `json_items(body)` parses a JSON array and returns the element bodies as
`vector<text>`.  There is no way for the compiler to verify that the caller's parse function
(e.g. `User.from_json`) receives a valid JSON object body rather than an arbitrary string.
A parse error at runtime produces a partial zero-value struct, not a diagnostic.
**Workaround:** Validate the HTTP response status before parsing (`if resp.ok()`).
**Fix path:** Deferred.  A `JsonValue` enum (covering Object, Array, String, Number, Boolean,
Null variants) would give compile-time structure, but the design cost is high.
**Effort:** Very High (deferred)
**Target:** 1.1+
**See also:** [WEB_SERVICES.md](WEB_SERVICES.md)

---

### 55. Thread-local `http_status()` is not parallel-safe
**Severity:** Medium — design trap; do not introduce this API
**Description:** An `http_status()` function returning the status of the most recent HTTP
call as a thread-local integer (the pattern used by C's `errno`) is tempting but incorrect
in loft's parallel execution model.  A `parallel_for` worker calling `http_get` would
corrupt the thread-local of the calling thread.
**Fix path:** Return an `HttpResponse` struct directly from all HTTP functions.  The status
is a field on the returned value, not global state.  See WEB_SERVICES.md Approach B.
**Effort:** N/A — this is a design constraint, not a bug to fix.  Simply do not add `http_status()`.
**Target:** Avoided by design

---

## File I/O Limitations

### 57. Binary file I/O panics on structs with collection-type fields

**Severity:** Medium — runtime panic with no compile-time diagnostic

**Symptom:** Calling `write_file` or `read_file` on a struct that contains a
`sorted<T>`, `index<T>`, or `hash<T>` field panics at runtime:
```
Not implemented type for file writing <type_name>
```

**Root cause:** `Stores::read_data` and `Stores::write_data` in `src/database/io.rs`
handle scalars (integer, long, single, float, boolean, text), plain enums, `Byte`,
`Short`, and `Vector` fields recursively.  They do not handle `Parts::Sorted`,
`Parts::Ordered`, `Parts::Hash`, or `Parts::Index` — these fall through to the `_`
panic arm.  Collection fields store a B-tree or hash-table root pointer that cannot
be meaningfully serialised by the current byte-array format.

**Workaround:** Do not use `read_file`/`write_file` on structs whose fields include
collection types.  Extract the scalar fields into a separate plain struct for
serialisation.

**Fix path:** Two options:
1. **Emit a compile-time error** in the parser when `write_file` or `read_file` is
   called with a type that contains collection fields (preferred — mirrors the spacial
   pre-gate pattern from issue #22).
2. **Implement serialisation** for collection fields in `read_data`/`write_data` —
   significantly more complex; requires a stable on-disk format for B-trees/hash tables.

Option 1 is the right first step: add a `has_collection_field(tp)` check at the call
sites in `native.rs` (lines near the `write_file` and `read_file` implementations) and
emit a compile-time error.  Option 2 can follow later if needed.

**Effort:** Small (option 1: compile-time guard); High (option 2: full serialisation)
