## The store model (the ground the rules stand on)

- **`H`** — the **heap**: a finite map `store_nr ⟼ Store`. `store_nr` is a `u16` slot index
  (`Stores.allocations`). Slot `0` is reserved for the interpreter's **evaluation stack**
  (`stack_store_at_zero`); it is never a freeable heap store.
- **`Store`** — a word-addressed byte region (`src/store.rs`): a header (signature,
  free-space index, record size) then content, with an intrusive free-block tree. It holds
  zero or more **records**, each a run of bytes at a record index.
- **`DbRef`** = `(store_nr: u16, rec: u32, pos: u32)` (`src/keys.rs`) — the **universal
  pointer** and a first-class runtime **value**: which store, which record, which byte
  offset within it. A field/element access is pointer arithmetic on `pos`.
- **`nullref`** — `DbRef::NULL`, the reference null. It is the `E-Null` sentinel of the
  reference types (the same in-band discipline as `integer`'s `i64::MIN`).
- **locks** — a `Store` may be `read_only` (immutable: writes and frees fault) or
  `free_protected` (soft: frees fault, writes allowed) — set by the const store, the fn-call
  deep-copy bracket (a caller's argument is protected-from-free for the call), and worker
  borrows. Locks are part of the contract, not an implementation detail: a backend that
  ignores a lock steps differently.

## Notation

- `σ = ⟨ρ, H⟩` — the store/environment splits into the variable map `ρ` (operational.md's
  `σ(x)`) and the heap `H`. `⟨e, σ⟩ → ⟨e', σ'⟩` is one small step, as in operational.md.
- `r` ranges over `DbRef` values; `r ⊕ n` is `r` with `pos` advanced by byte offset `n`
  (same store + record). `H[r]` is the value stored at `r` (read at its width); `H[r ↦ v]`
  is `H` updated at `r`.
- `store(r)` is `r.store_nr`; `H ⊢ r live` means `store(r) ∈ dom(H)` and that store is not
  freed. `fresh(H)` is a `store_nr` not in `dom(H)`.
- `⊥` is the faulting configuration **only** where noted; per operational.md's C80, most
  "can't" cases are the value `null` + continue, **not** a halt (see `H-ReadNull`).

## Rules

### Heap values and the reference null

```
  (H-Ref)      a DbRef r is a value (a normal form); it does not step.
  (H-RefNull)  nullref is the reference null — the per-type SENTINEL (E-Null) of a
               reference type.  Two configs that agree on the abstract reference (a live
               record, or nullref) MUST agree, however a backend encodes the sentinel.
```

**In words.** A heap reference is a finished value, just like an integer. `nullref` is a real
value (a reference that points at nothing), not a separate error state — the reference-typed
analogue of `integer`'s `i64::MIN` null.

### Allocation — a fresh store, zero-initialised

```
  (H-Alloc)    ⟨alloc τ, ⟨ρ, H⟩⟩ → ⟨r, ⟨ρ, H'⟩⟩
                 where s = fresh(H),  r = (s, 0, 0),
                       H' = H[s ↦ zeroed Store for τ]      (every field/element is its type's null/zero)
  (H-NewRec)   ⟨new-record r_v, ⟨ρ, H⟩⟩ → ⟨r_e, ⟨ρ, H'⟩⟩
                 a fresh record inside the vector/collection store r_v; r_e points at it,
                 its fields zero/null-initialised, the container's length grown by one.
```

**In words.** Allocating a struct/vector reserves a **fresh** store slot (`OpDatabase`) whose
content starts fully null/zero — a fresh `store_nr` distinct from every live store, so a new
value can never coincide with an existing one. Appending an element (`OpNewRecord` /
`OpFinishRecord`) claims a record inside the container's store. Construction is a pure
extension of `H`: it frees nothing and aliases nothing (this is why *constructing* a host
value is unrestricted under [capabilities.md](capabilities.md)'s `Cap-Own`).

### Read — through a live ref, or null-continue through nullref

```
  (H-Read)      ⟨read(r ⊕ n), ⟨ρ, H⟩⟩ → ⟨H[r ⊕ n], σ⟩            when H ⊢ r live
  (H-ReadNull)  ⟨read(nullref ⊕ n), σ⟩ → ⟨null, σ⟩               (deref of absent = null, CONTINUE)
  (H-Index)     ⟨read(r[i]), ⟨ρ, H⟩⟩ → ⟨H[r ⊕ stride·i], σ⟩       when 0 ≤ i < len(r)
                ⟨read(r[i]), σ⟩ → ⟨null, σ⟩                        when i out of bounds (OOB = null, CONTINUE)
```

**In words.** Reading a field/element is a read at the pointer's offset (`pos + field_offset`,
or `pos + stride·index`). Reading through **nullref**, or **out of bounds**, yields **null**
and execution **continues** — the same spreadsheet discipline as arithmetic (operational.md
`E-Uncomp`): an absent value degrades to null locally, it never halts the run.

### Write — update in place; null/lock faults are values or rejects, never wild writes

```
  (H-Write)      ⟨write(r ⊕ n, v), ⟨ρ, H⟩⟩ → ⟨v, ⟨ρ, H[r ⊕ n ↦ v]⟩⟩   when H ⊢ r live, store(r) writable
  (H-WriteNull)  ⟨write(nullref ⊕ n, v), σ⟩ → ⟨v, σ⟩                    (no store to update; a no-op step)
  (H-WriteOOB)   ⟨write(r[i], v), σ⟩ → ⟨v, σ⟩                           when i out of bounds (no-op, CONTINUE)
  (H-WriteLocked)  a write to a read_only store is a STATIC reject where provable, else a
                   runtime lock fault — never a silent successful write.
```

**In words.** A write updates the byte(s) at the target and yields the written value. A write
**through nullref** or **out of bounds** targets no live cell, so it is a no-op that continues
(it must never scribble on an arbitrary address — the null discipline extends to the write
side). A write to a **locked** store is refused (the `#lock` runtime guard / const store),
never silently applied. Crucially, a write's target ROOT decides whose state it touches: a
write whose root is a **parameter** mutates the caller's value; a write to a **local** touches
only that local's own store (see `H-Copy`) — the exact fact [capabilities.md](capabilities.md)'s
`Cap-Own`/raw-write admission rests on.

### Copy — a whole-value bind duplicates the store (C86), it does not alias

```
  (H-Copy)   ⟨x = r, ⟨ρ, H⟩⟩ → ⟨r', ⟨ρ[x ↦ r'], H'⟩⟩
               where r' = (fresh(H), 0, 0),  H' = H[store(r')] := deep-copy of the record graph at r
             — a WHOLE-VALUE heap bind (a struct/vector value copied into x) allocates a fresh
               store and duplicates the reachable record graph; x and the source are then
               INDEPENDENT.  A PROJECTION that stays a view (`p = o.field` where the field is a
               scalar-place borrow) is governed by binding.md/ownership.md, not H-Copy.
```

**In words.** Binding a whole heap value — `c = v`, `s = other`, `fv = e.items`, even
`r = &v` for a vector — **copies** it into a fresh store; the two are then independent, so
mutating one never affects the other. This is [DESIGN_DECISIONS.md C86](../DESIGN_DECISIONS.md)
(`#415` is the semantic, not a stopgap), and it is **observable and proven on both backends**:
`fv = e.items; fv[0] = 99` leaves `e.items[0] == 1`; `r = &v; r[0] = 99` leaves `v[0] == 1`.
It is the ground fact that makes a local's raw write always script-owned
([capabilities.md](capabilities.md) D-cap-3): the only write that reaches another binding's
state is a write whose ROOT is that binding (a parameter), never a copy of it.

### Free — release a store, in LIFO order, never the stack, never twice

```
  (H-Free)       ⟨free(r), ⟨ρ, H⟩⟩ → ⟨(), ⟨ρ, H \ store(r)⟩⟩
                   when H ⊢ r live, store(r) is the MOST-RECENTLY-ALLOCATED live heap store,
                   store(r) ≠ 0 (not the eval stack), and store(r) not free_protected.
  (H-FreeNull)   ⟨free(nullref), σ⟩ → ⟨(), σ⟩                      (freeing null is a no-op)
  (H-FreeLIFO)   freeing a store that is NOT the current top of the allocation order is a
                 FAULT — the LIFO discipline (a store's lifetime nests within those allocated
                 before it).
  (H-FreeStack)  freeing store 0 (the evaluation stack) is a FAULT (#306): a stack-record ref
                 is never an owned heap store.
  (H-FreeTwice)  freeing an already-freed store is a FAULT (use-after-free / double-free).
```

**In words.** `free` releases a store slot and everything in it. It is disciplined: (1) **LIFO** —
you free stores in reverse allocation order, because a store's lifetime is nested inside the
stores allocated before it; (2) never the **stack** store (a `#306` bug is exactly a
stack-record ref mistaken for an owned heap store); (3) never **twice** (a double-free), and
never a store still reachable from a live binding (a use-after-free); (4) never a
`free_protected` store (a caller's argument during a call). `free(nullref)` is a harmless no-op.
Unlike a read/write, a bad free is a genuine **fault**, not a null-continue — it corrupts the
heap, so the discipline is a hard invariant, not a degradable value.

### The soundness bridge — a well-typed program never faults a free

```
  (H-Sound)   if a program is `deps`-SOUND (ownership.md O-Derived + O-Complete: every free
              it emits is on an OWNED store at its last use), then no execution reaches a
              faulting free — H-FreeLIFO / H-FreeStack / H-FreeTwice never fire, and no read
              observes a freed store.  The static checker discharges the dynamic invariant.
```

**In words.** These free rules describe what a free *does* and when it *would* corrupt the heap.
The promise that a real loft program never hits a corrupting free is **not** re-checked at
runtime — it is discharged statically by [ownership.md](ownership.md)'s `deps` checker (now at
**0 open deviations**): the checker only emits a free on a store the value provably OWNS, at its
last use, so LIFO holds, the stack is never freed, and nothing freed is later read. This doc
defines the cliff; ownership.md proves the program walks the path beside it. The
`LOFT_POISON` harness is the empirical cross-check: it overwrites freed stores with a poison
pattern so any surviving `H-FreeTwice` / use-after-free surfaces as a corrupted read.

---

## Deviations

OPEN: **0** (this doc closes a *rules* gap, not a code deviation).

Writing these rules **shrinks** [operational.md](operational.md)'s D-op-1 — the heap/store
steps it named as *"unwritten … the interpreter remains their spec"* now have a written
contract (this file). What remains is the SAME meta-deviation, not a heap-specific one:

- **Conformance is differential, not definitional** — the heap steps here are enforced across
  the two backends by the @PLN89 **differential oracle** (D-op-1), whose corpus deliberately
  exercises the heap-heavy areas (collections, text, keyed collections, coroutines) where the
  interpreter's store and the native generator's `DbRef` ABI use the most different mechanisms.
  A program whose heap steps diverge is caught there. This doc does not add a new open row; it
  supplies the contract the oracle's heap-touching cases are read against.
- **The lifetime side is CLOSED** — the free discipline's soundness (`H-Sound`) rests on
  [ownership.md](ownership.md), which is at **0 open deviations** (2026-07-04): every
  store-lifetime decision reads the one `deps` fact, and the fact is total. So the historically
  #1-weakness area — the free rules above — is the one with the strongest standing proof, not
  the weakest.

---

## Conformance

The rules are checkable directly, and every check is a program both backends must agree on:

- **Copy-not-alias (`H-Copy`)** — `struct Ent { items: vector<integer> }`,
  `e = Ent { items: [1,2,3] }; fv = e.items; fv[0] = 99` ⇒ `e.items[0] == 1` on BOTH backends
  (proven; the D-cap-3 probe). Likewise `v = [1,2,3]; r = &v; r[0] = 99` ⇒ `v[0] == 1`.
- **Null/OOB continue (`H-ReadNull` / `H-Index`)** — reading a field of `nullref`, or `v[i]`
  with `i ≥ len(v)`, is **null** and the program continues; it never halts (operational.md
  C80, extended to the heap).
- **Parameter-root write escapes, local-root write does not (`H-Write` / `H-Copy`)** —
  `fn f(v: vector<integer>) { v[0] = 99 }` mutates the caller's vector (`orig[0] == 99`);
  binding first, `fn f(v) { c = v; c[0] = 99 }`, does not (`orig[0] == 1`). This IS the
  capabilities raw-write boundary.
- **Free discipline (`H-Free*`)** — the `LOFT_POISON` suite + the ownership fuzz gate are the
  standing falsifiers: any `H-FreeTwice` / use-after-free / out-of-LIFO free surfaces as a
  poisoned read or a leak-count mismatch. The register that guarantees they never fire is
  ownership.md (0 open).

D-op-1's falsifier applies here too: any program where the interpreter and `--native` diverge
on a heap step is the definitional error, and this doc is the definition it fails against.
