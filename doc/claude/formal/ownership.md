## Notation

- **owner** — the binding or slot responsible for freeing a heap store. Exactly one at a
  time.
- **borrow / alias** — a value that *refers to* a store it does not own (a parameter, a
  field/element read, a `&τ` link). It must not free, and must not outlive its source.
- **`deps`** — the per-binding fact recording what it owns and what it borrows from. The
  one fact every store-lifetime decision reads. (Today a `Vec<u16>`; see D-own-3.)
- **transfer / move** — handing ownership to another binding (e.g. a return). The giver
  stops owning; it must not free what it moved.

---

## Rules

> The model is **sound** (no use-after-free, no double-free, no leak) **and complete**
> (computed for *every* binding, every path). The five invariants:

```
  (O-Owner)     SINGLE OWNER.  Every heap store has exactly one owner at any moment.
  (O-Move)      MOVE ON RETURN.  A returned heap value's ownership transfers to the
                caller's binding; the callee never frees what it transfers.  If the return
                *borrows* a parameter, the return type records it (`{Attr(param)}`) and the
                caller COPIES to obtain its own store.
  (O-Borrow)    BORROW TRACKING.  A value aliasing another (param / field / element / `&τ`)
                carries the source in its `deps`; the borrower is skip-free; the single
                owner frees once.
  (O-Derived)   FREE PLACEMENT IS DERIVED, NOT DECIDED.  Free a local iff it owns its store
                and does not transfer it out — once, at scope exit.  No per-site heuristic.
  (O-Complete)  PER BINDING, PER PATH, COMPLETE.  Every binding, including every `match`/`if`
                arm — a set-and-reconcile, not a single-variable structural walk.
```

**In words.** One thing owns each piece of heap, and it's the only thing that frees it.
When you return a heap value you *give it away* (the function stops owning it); if you
only return a view into an argument, the type says so and the caller makes its own copy.
Anything that just borrows is tracked but never frees. Crucially, *where* to free is
**computed** from these facts, not guessed per code-site — and it's computed for **every**
binding on **every** branch, not just the easy ones.

**This is an INTERNAL system — it never rejects a program it can compile.** loft has no
user-facing borrow checker; the user writes naively and the compiler always finds a valid
lowering, copying when it cannot prove an alias is safe
([OWNERSHIP_MODEL.md § Internal and invisible](../OWNERSHIP_MODEL.md)).
That makes **`O-Complete` the load-bearing invariant**: an incomplete fact is not a compile
error the user fixes — it is a miscompile or a leak. So the failure mode to fear here is
*incompleteness* (D-own-2), not just unsoundness — the analysis must be **total**.

The single carve-out is not in this doc's rules at all, and stays that way: where NO correct
lowering exists — an explicit `&` reference whose place the program then destroys — the
*binding surface* declines the program ([binding.md](binding.md) B-Ref-Reshape, C79 revisited
2026-08-05). That is a decision about what `&` MEANS, not a lifetime the checker failed to
prove, so it changes nothing here: these rules still never reject, and the deps fact is still
computed for every binding on every path. A program this doc's rules would have handled fine is
never refused.

### The mechanism — one fact, derived everywhere

```
  (O-Deps)      every store-lifetime codegen decision — free placement, adopt-vs-copy,
                move-vs-clone, drop — DERIVES MECHANICALLY from the single `deps` fact.
                If a decision is re-derived by a codegen condition, that is the bug.
  (O-NoDiverge) because both backends translate the SAME `deps` facts, the interpreter and
                `--native` cannot diverge.  (This is the soundness side of
                [operational.md](operational.md)'s shared contract: O-NoDiverge is *why*
                E-Op/E-Trap agree across backends.)
```

**In words.** `deps` is the single source of truth. Every "do I free / copy / move this
store?" question is *answered by reading `deps`*, never re-worked out in the code
generator. And because both backends read the same answer, they can't disagree — which is
exactly what makes the operational rules hold on native as well as interp.

---

## Deviations

OPEN: **1** (D-own-8, 2026-08-24) — D-own-7 opened and closed 2026-08-23, and D-own-6 before
it; the five original D-own deviations remain resolved.  Read those entries for what their
oracles vary before treating any zero here as a measurement: each rested on a Join corpus that
pinned one axis, and moving that axis found a fresh family every time — which is exactly how
D-own-8 arrived, from a consumer rather than from an oracle at all.

### D-own-8 — OPEN (2026-08-24, loft#1082): a Join's ownership fact is true on one path only

`(O-Complete)` requires the fact PER BINDING, PER PATH — "every binding, including every
`match`/`if` arm".  A join whose arms disagree about ownership produces ONE fact for BOTH
paths, and the one it produces is the borrow:

```loft
line = if len(pts) > 2 { smooth_pts(pts, flags, false) } else { pts };
```

The then-arm is a call returning a freshly-owned vector; the else-arm is a bare local.
`LOFT_VAR_TABLE` shows the binding typed `def deps=[pts]` — a BORROW — so on the owning path
the fact is false, and a borrow-typed binding owns no store for that path's value to land in.
The whole-value assignment then targets nothing:

```
VarVector(var[1224]) -> null
ClearVector(r=ref(65535,0,0))
AppendVector(r=ref(65535,0,0), other=ref(26,1,8), tp=3)   ← panic
```

`store_nr == u16::MAX` is `DbRef::NULL`, against `keys.rs`'s stated contract that "every store
accessor consults it before dereferencing".  The `debug_assert!` that would name the variable
is compiled out of a release build, so the shipped failure is a bare index panic.

**What is NOT the cause, each eliminated by its own run.**  Reassigning over a field view;
passing local copies instead of field views; `LOFT_NO_CONF_RECOVER=1` (store confinement); and
loft2's move-elide / DbRef-set work (`812aac5d` fixed the INVERSE — a borrow read as an owned
store — and the panic survives it unchanged).  A `Type::joined_deps` change making an owning
arm win the union looked implied by the rule and did NOT fix it when measured, so the union is
suspicious but is not the producer of the null `DbRef`.

**The oracle gap.**  Three constructed reductions failed to reproduce it — an if-expression
assigned then appended to, the same consumed by a struct literal, and a hand-written
Catmull-Rom over a struct field of a loop variable — so the minimal repro is still open and the
trigger needs something those lack.  It reproduces reliably in the `drawing` package's `Fronds`
path (`bow=0.16`, parse only, no render); `bow` is the sole trigger because it is what makes a
frond three control points and routes it into the smoothing.

The next step is the PRODUCER, not another hypothesis: instrument the write of a `DbRef` whose
`store_nr` is `u16::MAX` into a vector-typed local, which names the emit site directly.

### D-own-7 — CLOSED (2026-08-23, loft#1078): every arm of a Join that OWNS a store is a candidate the free must name

`(O-Derived)` says free a local iff it owns its store and does not transfer it out.  A tail
`if`/`match` whose arms each own a store transfers exactly ONE of them, so the others are
locals that must be freed — and the promoted NRVO buffer is one of those arms.

`fn pick(c) -> S { w = S { a: 7 }; if c { S { a: 9 } } else { w } }` renames `w` onto the
hidden return buffer, so the `else` arm delivers the buffer and the `if` arm delivers a
different store.  `scopes::free_vars` reaches the losers through three legs — a null arm
(@PLN85 A.1), a promoted buffer no arm names (loft#688), and arms that disagree about
ownership (loft#1022) — and the multi-source leg that covers *"several owned candidates, one
winner"* excluded every ARGUMENT.  That exclusion is right for a user parameter, which belongs
to the caller, and wrong for the one argument that is really a local this function minted.
loft#1022's own comment had already named the carve-out and applied it inside its own gate;
the multi-source leg needed the same one.  One orphan per call, both backends, invisible in a
single call — `loft_planet` retained ~16,000 records per planet and four planets exhausted the
65,535-entry `store_nr` table.

**What the oracle held fixed, and what moving it found.** The filed report varied *what the
non-taken arm names* (a local, a parameter, a vector element) and held the RETURN POSITION and
the arm COUNT fixed.  Moving those two found two `silent-wrong` defects the leak had hidden,
neither of them an ownership fact:

* **Two owned locals** — the first is renamed onto the buffer, and the second's copy leg emits
  `OpDatabase(buf); OpCopyRecord(<tail that reads buf>, buf)`.  The re-mint destroys the store
  the copy is about to read, so the renamed arm answered a zeroed record.  A three-arm `match`
  broke only its FIRST arm, which is the tell that the buffer RENAME is the mechanism and the
  join is not.
* **Bound, then returned** (`r = if c { … } else { w }; r`) — not a tail join at all.  This is
  loft#848's class one arm over: the pass-2-only object-literal mint still drew from the shared
  `__ref_N` counter, so pass 2 handed it the name pass 1 had left on the return buffer, and
  `return_buffer()` resolves that buffer BY NAME.  The arm's record and the return destination
  became one slot.

Both answered wrong IDENTICALLY on the two backends, so `(O-NoDiverge)` held while
`(O-Owner)` did not — a reminder that backend agreement is not an oracle.  Guard:
`tests/scripts/1078-join-arms-that-each-own-a-store.loft`, both halves falsified on a pristine
worktree at `f7a57124` (the value cells by assertion, the leak cell by the wrap leak gate).

### D-own-6 — CLOSED (2026-08-20, loft#1029): the runtime Join witness now covers every argument it can name

`(O-Complete)` accepts the Join as *inherently runtime*: a callee whose return may borrow a
parameter is completed per-path by the @P290 bracket — `protect_store_frees` marks each ref
argument's store, and a returned store that is marked is refused the source-free while a
callee-minted one is freed.  The register closed D-own-2 on that basis.

The witness was not total.  The bracket needs a slot to name, so
`use_analysis::protectable_ref_args` accepted only a bare `Var`; for any other argument
spelling `covers_all` went false and the caller fell back to the conservative never-free
answer, orphaning the store the callee minted — one record per call, both backends.  The
axis is the ARGUMENT SPELLING, not what the borrow arm names: a vector-element borrow arm
leaks with a literal argument, and a parameter borrow arm is clean with a variable one.

The rule that closes it: **the witness names a STORE, not the argument.**
`protect_store_frees` marks an allocation and reaches it through any `DbRef` in that store, so
an argument only has to be DERIVED from a nameable slot by operations that stay inside one
store.  Two families, and they need opposite cures:

* **A view of a live slot** — `b.s`, `d.b.s`, `w[0]`, `vb.v`, `o ?? q`, `if c { q } else { r }`.
  The root of a projection chain is the witness, and a join witnesses every arm.  Nothing is
  hoisted; the slot already holds its `DbRef` when the bracket runs.
* **A construction block**, which MINTS the store it yields — a struct or collection literal.
  This one cannot be witnessed in place: the bracket is emitted before the arguments evaluate,
  so the work-ref still holds its null and marking it would protect nothing while reading as
  covered — trading the leak for a use-after-free.  It is hoisted into the enclosing statement
  list instead, which is the spelling (`q = S { a: 7 }; pick(q, …)`) that was always clean.

`null` in either spelling holds no store and needs no witness (loft#1021).

**The oracle that missed this** varied the instantiating TYPE and the join SHAPE and never
varied how the argument was SPELLED — every cell in `1019-join-owned-arm-owner.loft` binds its
argument to a variable first, and a corpus that sweeps four axes impressively is read as
coverage.  `tests/scripts/1029-inline-argument-borrow-source.loft` now moves that axis across
eleven spellings, each asserting BOTH arms plus the source's own value and, for a collection,
its length — because a cure that freed the DELIVERED store answers the same number on the
owning arm, and only a length or a source read can witness it.  The type-variable half of the
same gap is recorded in [interfaces.md](interfaces.md).

---

OPEN: ~~0~~ (2026-07-04, superseded above) — **the ownership register was at zero.**  All five D-own
deviations are resolved: D-own-3 (typed `Deps`) CLOSED; D-own-4 RECLASSIFIED as the
decided edge C86 (whole-value binds copy; aliasing is a last-use elision —
`classify_vec_bind`); D-own-5 (the `&` borrow rides `deps`) CLOSED; **D-own-2
(O-Complete) CLOSED** (the ownership fact is total — oracle covers every value, the free
side reads it, the inherently-runtime Join completed per-path by the `_own_store`
witness; validated by the 6-shape sweep + full gates + the `program_ownership` fuzzer);
and now **D-own-1 (O-Deps) CLOSED** — an audit of every store-lifetime DECISION site
(dispatch.rs / state/codegen.rs / ops/ref_ops.rs / scopes.rs / control.rs) found the
free/copy/adopt/drop decisions read the ONE canonical fact
(`ownership_of` / `returns_borrowed_view` / `return_adopts_fresh_store`) on the shipped
path — the last inline shape-scan (the interp adopt-vs-deep-copy visible-ref-param scan)
was unified onto `return_adopts_fresh_store()` matching the native sibling (commit
`0234cbbb`).  **The floor (honest):** the pre-fact scans survive ONLY under the
`LOFT_NO_JOIN_OWN` opt-out (differential-control machinery, not shipped behaviour); the
runtime Join witnesses (`_own_store`/`OpBindOrCopy`) are inherently-runtime (spec-accepted,
not a re-derivation); and collapsing the return-ownership readers into ONE physical funnel
is code-DRY, not a re-derivation (each already reads the fact).  Those are reclassified as
non-deviation cleanup — the O-Deps SUBSTANCE (no shipped decision re-derives ownership; the
fact is carried and read everywhere) is met.  Validated: full suite 2601/2601 (env flakes
only), `native_scripts`, `LOFT_POISON`, the `ownership_fuzz_gate` control pairs, the
differential oracle, and the fuzzer.

### D-own-1 — CLOSED (2026-07-04): ownership is carried as one `deps` fact, read (not re-derived) per-site
- **Violated:** O-Derived / O-Deps
- **Where:** the store-lifetime bug class — `has_ref_params`, the return-source set, the
  free-suppress / return-buffer logic, etc. ([OWNERSHIP_MODEL.md § Why](../OWNERSHIP_MODEL.md)).
  Each fix added a codegen condition rather than completing a fact.
- **Effect:** the recurring store-lifetime bugs (Cluster A, #426, #429, …) — "N forests,
  one root". The class cannot be closed by more conditions.
- **@PLN85 note (2026-07-04):** the store-lifetime BUG class is retired (@PLN85 closed) —
  the load-bearing re-derivations are ELIMINATED (return-delivery + reassign thicket
  collapsed behind `classify_X`/`dispatch_X`; the `ownership_of` oracle default-on, 0/54
  over-free; the free side reads `returns_borrowed_view()`) and no re-derivation produces
  a live bug (closed by construction: fuzz/poison/DA + leak-gate).
- **@PLN90 note (2026-07-04):** the LAST per-site ownership re-derivation is now GONE —
  `scan_set`'s owned-vs-view TRACKER (`ref_rhs_ownership`) no longer re-derives from the
  RHS shape; it reads the ONE canonical `ownership_of` oracle (Owned → track; Borrowed
  AND Join → View, since a borrow/join reassignment displaces the prior owned store and
  must not be tracked as owned).  So O-Derived is SATISFIED: every store-lifetime
  decision now reads the one canonical fact, not a per-site shape scan.  Validated: full
  suite + `native_scripts` + DA + `LOFT_POISON` + differential oracle green; the p462
  conditional `?? m_none()` transition and the C86 copy-return cases all clean both
  backends.  **The D-own-2 residual is now CLOSED too** (see below): the `_ => Owned`
  tail is correct (it covers only fresh-owned / scalar / payload-less values, not a
  hole), the value-vs-bind gap is INERT for the free decision (the reassign pre-free +
  type-based scope-exit free cover it), and the inherently-runtime Join is completed
  per-path by the `_own_store` witness — so the ownership fact is TOTAL.  O-Derived:
  **CLOSED** — the re-derivation is deleted.  What stays under D-own-1 is only the
  *single-fact* unification: the free/copy/move decisions read the canonical fact at
  their chokepoints, but three cooperating mechanisms (the static oracle read + the
  runtime Join witnesses + the return-buffer machinery) are not yet ONE `deps` read.
- **Status:** CLOSED (2026-07-04) — the audit + `0234cbbb` unification landed the last
  shipped shape-scan onto the fact (see the header for the close + the honest floor).
  History below.  Landed: the return-delivery
  collapse is COMPLETE — `block_result` 459→328 lines, **45→21 helper calls**, the 15
  tail-shape classifiers down to ~3 genuinely-distinct entry guards; EVERY delivery
  mechanism routes through a pure `classify_X` selector + `dispatch_X` (vector
  `Delivery`, Reference `RefDelivery`, text `TextDep`, `ref_return`'s
  `classify_ret_promotion`); the #416/#448 cells folded; class swept dry over ~41
  probes.  The `ownership_of` oracle chokepoints are **DEFAULT-ON**
  (`keys.rs::join_own_enabled`; 54-cell over-free map 0/54 default).  And the FREE
  side began reading the canonical fact: `scan_set`'s #316 ownership tracker
  (`ref_rhs_ownership`) and codegen's owned-ref reassign gate now call
  `returns_borrowed_view()` instead of re-scanning the return deps inline (2026-07-04,
  both byte-identical over the 8 D-own-1/C86/462 corpora).
  **AUDIT 2026-07-04 — the consumption side is now ~fully fact-reading.** A sweep of
  every store-lifetime DECISION site (dispatch.rs, state/codegen.rs, ops/ref_ops.rs,
  scopes.rs, control.rs) found the free/copy/adopt/drop decisions read the canonical
  fact (`ownership_of` / `returns_borrowed_view` / `return_adopts_fresh_store`)
  everywhere but ONE genuine residual, plus two non-violations:
  - **THE ONE RESIDUAL — `state/codegen.rs:1786-1789`**: the interp `v = call()`
    deep-copy path still gates on an inline *visible-ref-param scan* to decide
    adopt-vs-deep-copy, while the NATIVE sibling (`dispatch.rs:405`) already reads
    `return_adopts_fresh_store()`.  For a fresh-return-with-ref-param callee
    (`fn mk_from(seed) -> Box { Box{..} }`) interp deep-copies where native adopts —
    same value + leak-clean on both, but a mechanism divergence.  Unifying it onto
    the fact is a COPY-ELIMINATION small-step (adopt instead of deep-copy), not
    byte-identical — best done as a dedicated @PLN90 slice on this most-reverted
    path, with the corpus+matrix gate, NOT rushed.
  - NOT violations: `dispatch.rs:403-404` (`.starts_with("n_")` / `code()!=Null` are
    call-KIND eligibility filters, the ownership decision reads the fact at 405);
    `scopes.rs collect_return_sources` (the return-source SET is the row-268 fact
    PRODUCER for the match/if union, not a consumption re-derivation).
  REMAINING: (1) the single copy-elim unification above + the architectural funnel of
  the 3 return paths (row 273) into one return-ownership computation — mechanical, no
  live bug; (2) the `??`-JOIN
  runtime witness (`OpBindOrCopy`/`OpFreeRefIfDistinct`/`_own_store`) is inherently
  runtime (the
  arm taken is unknown at compile time), not a re-derivation to delete.  D-own-5's
  `&`-borrow fact is CLOSED (folded).
- **Removal — DONE:** every free/copy/move reads `deps` (via `ownership_of` /
  `returns_borrowed_view` / `return_adopts_fresh_store`) on the shipped path; the
  per-site heuristics survive only under the `LOFT_NO_JOIN_OWN` opt-out (control
  machinery).  Non-deviation cleanup left: DELETE the opt-out scans once the differential
  controls retire, and collapse the return-ownership readers into one physical funnel
  (pure DRY — each already reads the fact).

### D-own-2 — CLOSED (2026-07-04, @PLN90): the ownership fact is TOTAL
- **Violated:** O-Complete
- **Where:** the row-100/102 holes — adopt-vs-copy for arbitrary borrowing returns; the
  general dep-driven caller copy. (The struct-field and value-`if`-return facets closed
  earlier — #415, a7.)
- **What CLOSES it — the analysis is now total, and validated total.**  O-Complete's
  failure mode is *incompleteness → a silent miscompile or leak* (line 64-66): a
  binding/path with NO computed ownership fact, falling back to a heuristic/stopgap.  That
  is now eliminated on three fronts:
  1. **The static fact is total and correct.**  `ownership_of` (use_analysis.rs) computes
     an `Own` for EVERY `Value`: `OpDatabase`/`OpNewRecord`/literals/scalars → `Owned`;
     a projection → `Borrowed{base}`; a user call → the interprocedural `call_ownership`;
     `??`/`if` → the `join` of its arms; block/insert → its tail.  The `_ => Owned` tail
     is not a hole — it covers only literals / scalar-void ops / payload-less control,
     which ARE fresh-owned or heap-irrelevant (verified against the classifier).
  2. **The free side READS that one fact** (the D-own-1 fold): `scan_set`'s #316 tracker
     (`ref_rhs_ownership`) is a pure `ownership_of` read — `Owned → Owned`, `Borrowed`/
     `Join → View`.  The three-valued gap is closed: `RefRhs::Unknown` is DELETED (dead
     once the oracle covers every value), so the free side is a total 2-valued read of
     the oracle, not a separate structural walk.
  3. **The inherently-runtime JOIN is completed per-path at runtime.**  Where a binding's
     ownership genuinely differs per path (`r = x; for { r = v[i] ?? x }` — owned copy on
     the empty path, a borrowed view once the ncc runs), a static per-binding fact CANNOT
     decide (the spec accepts this as inherently runtime, see D-own-1 residual (2)).  The
     `_own_store_<name>` witness (generation/, @PLN90 loft#495 / commits 44fd7d72 +
     a4bcad5b) is exactly the "set-and-reconcile across arms" O-Complete's removal
     criterion asks for — done at runtime: it tracks the store r actually owns, so BOTH
     the displaced-free and the scope-exit free release the owned store and never the
     view.  This is the last binding-shape whose free decision was previously incomplete.
- **The residuals — all COMPUTED and SAFE, not holes** (probed both backends,
  [plans/85 D-own-2-completeness.md § Sweep](../plans/85-store-lifetime-retirement/D-own-2-completeness.md)):
  (i) the **value-vs-bind gap** (`ownership_of(x)=Borrowed` for a `r = x` whole-value
  COPY that owns) is INERT for the free decision — the reassign pre-free + type-based
  scope-exit free release the displaced/final store regardless of the tracker's read;
  and for the transition class the witness's `is_var_copy` reads the bind as owned.
  (ii) the **deps-carried-join** (`r = pick(v,i)`, `pick = v[i] ?? Box{..}`) is a
  COMPUTED `Own::Join`, classified conservatively as a view — correct: the OWNED arm is
  materialised into the return buffer whose own lifetime frees it, so `r` views it (no
  leak / no double-free, both arms exercised).
- **Validated total:** the transition class swept dry over 6 shapes (2 live over-frees
  found + fixed, 4 safe), the value-vs-bind + deps-join residuals probed clean+poison,
  the full suite 2600/2600 (env flakes only), `native_scripts`, `LOFT_POISON`, native
  leak-check, DA, the differential oracle, AND the `program_ownership` fuzzer (3108 execs,
  0 findings — the "unfuzzed axis" concern discharged).  No binding/path produces a live
  miscompile; the analysis is total.
- **Not this deviation:** unifying the runtime witness + return-buffer machinery INTO the
  single `deps` read (rather than three cooperating mechanisms) is the *single-fact*
  ideal — that rides **D-own-1 (O-Deps)**, which stays open.  And the adopt-vs-view
  *optimisation* for a Join return (view is correct; adopt would save a copy) is
  copy-elimination — **@PLN90's LINT charter**, not an O-Complete correctness item.

### D-own-3 — CLOSED (2026-06-12, recounted into the register 2026-07-03): typed `Deps`
The dep list was a raw `Vec<u16>` overloading five meanings across two address spaces.
The H2 migration ([DEPS_INVENTORY.md](../DEPS_INVENTORY.md), steps 1–5) landed the
`Deps` newtype with named constructors at every creation site, space-checked queries
(`frame_vars` / `as_attr_indices`, debug space tags), and the `CALLEE_FRAME_BIT` VALUE
tag (0x8000) so the one cross-space provenance (the vectors.rs lambda propagation)
survives the IR codec unambiguously.  Residual (not a deviation): the newtype `Deref`s
to `Vec<u16>` for read convenience — writes go through the typed constructors.

### D-own-4 — RECLASSIFIED (2026-07-03, C86): the #415 copy IS the semantic; derive it, don't reverse it
The entry claimed the #415 struct-vector-field copy-on-bind was a stopgap contradicting
reference-default.  The reversal attempt found the premise false: on BOTH backends every
WHOLE-VALUE heap bind copies (`p = o`, `b = x`, `af = bx.v`) and only projections alias —
the written law, not the code, was wrong.  The maker's call
([DESIGN_DECISIONS C86](../DESIGN_DECISIONS.md#c86--whole-value-heap-binds-copy-aliasing-is-a-last-use-elision-the-rustc-rule)):
whole-value binds COPY by contract; `p = o` becomes an alias only when the source is
provably dead afterwards — the rustc last-use rule, as an OPTIMIZATION
(`use_analysis::ElidePlan` is that analysis).  `O-Borrow` scopes to projections /
params / `&τ`.  (binding.md D-bind-3 was already closed — the old "blocks" claim was
stale.)  The implementable RESIDUAL — the copy/alias/elide decision at the bind site
derives from the ownership fact instead of the syntactic `struct_vec_field` branch —
folds into **D-own-1**.  **Narrowed 2026-07-03:** the decision is now the pure
`classify_vec_bind` selector (`VecBind`, parser/expressions.rs — byte-identical
extraction over the C86 bind corpus): the verdict reads the base var's
incrementally-maintained `deps` (the same fact `ownership_of` reconstructs post-parse
via its whole-body `Defs` walk — Owned ⇒ copy, Borrowed/Join ⇒ view; agreement
witnessed by `LOFT_MATERIALIZE_DUMP` over the corpus), and the ELIDE half is already
live post-parse (`elision_plans` → `scopes::elide_borrows`).  What remains of D-own-1
here: the mid-parse deps read and the post-parse oracle are two implementations of one
fact — they unify when ownership is carried as one typed `deps` fact end-to-end.

### D-own-5 — CLOSED (2026-07-03, folded): the `&` borrow now carries its source in `deps`
- **Was:** @PLN87's ladder L1–L6 realised live references ([binding.md](binding.md),
  verified), but the `&τ` borrow's source was carried by a side-flag (`skip_free` on the
  L5 heap whole-value alias), not the `deps` fact the checker reads.
- **The fold (executed):** the L5 bind (`p = &o`, the only `&` binder with a free
  decision) now types `p: &Reference(td, [o])` via the standard `depending()` carrier —
  free suppression derives from `owns = dep.is_empty()` (`scopes::get_free_vars`), the
  same O-Borrow read every other borrow uses; the `set_skip_free` side-channel at the
  bind is deleted.  Proof: the ladder introspects change ONLY in the type display
  (`&ref(Pair)` → `&ref(Pair)["whole"]`) — zero op changes, both backends green,
  leak-gated (434-pln87-scalar-reference, 28-references, 87-store-leaks).
- **Residual sliver (recorded under [D-own-1](#d-own-1)):** a scalar-place ref
  (`c = &v[0]`, `r = &s.x`) holds a DbRef into the source's store, but a scalar inner
  carries no `Deps` slot (`depending()` is the identity), so the link is not a readable
  fact — vacuous for FREE placement (the binder owns no store) but unavailable to any
  future lifetime check until `Deps` is carried type-wide (the D-own-1/D-own-2
  completion).

## Machine-checkable soundness — the @PLN94 flow-sensitive oracle (proof skeleton)

The register above is **validation, not a machine-checked proof**: the shipped fact is computed
flow-INSENSITIVELY (the join of all defs) and the `Join` case discharges through a runtime witness.
[@PLN94](../plans/94-cfg-ownership-dataflow/) builds the flow-SENSITIVE replacement — a monotone
dataflow fixpoint (`src/ownership_cfg.rs`) run BESIDE the shipped analysis as an independent oracle,
never driving codegen (SI-1). Being a textbook abstract interpretation, that oracle is the piece that
CAN carry a machine-checked proof. This section states the obligations and discharges them — the
substantive lemma (4), local transfer soundness, is now proved case by case below (hand-written prose;
a Coq/Lean rendering is the only rigour polish left). The result: the flow-sensitive fact is
**over-free-sound given the O-\* rules**, so a green check is a proof-backed over-free-freedom
certificate on every program where the oracle and shipped analysis agree.

**What is proved, and what is not.** The target is the **over-free** class only — no free of a store
the fact does not own (⇒ no use-after-free, no double-free of that store). It is **NOT** a no-leak
proof (under-free is a disjoint class the shipped leak-check owns — @PLN94's coexistence finding:
`LOFT_NO_JOIN_OWN` leaks past this oracle but not past the leak detector). And it proves the
**oracle**, not the codegen: the shipped path inherits the certificate only where the two agree,
which is why they run beside forever.

**(1) The abstract domain — DISCHARGED.** `OFact = ⊥ | Owned | Borrowed(b) | Join(b)` with meet `⊔`
is a join-semilattice (finite height ≤ 3), and `refines` is its partial order. *Proof:*
`ofact_meet_is_a_join_semilattice` + `ofact_refines_marks_precision_and_flags_the_unsound_direction`
(unit tests, `src/ownership_cfg.rs`).

**(2) The concrete property.** In [operational.md](operational.md)'s `⟨e, σ⟩ → ⟨e', σ'⟩` with the
[heap.md](heap.md) store `H`, define at each program point the relation *owns(v)* = the var whose
binding is responsible for freeing `v`'s store (per **O-Owner**: exactly one). A free of `v` is
**sound** iff `owns(v) = v` at that point (**O-Derived**). Over-free = a sound-fact says `Owned`
where concretely `owns(v) ≠ v`.

**(3) The Galois connection.** `γ(Owned) =` { states where `owns(v)=v` }; `γ(Borrowed(b)) =` { states
where `v` aliases `b`'s store, `owns(v)=owns(b)≠v` } (**O-Borrow**); `γ(Join(b)) = γ(Owned) ∪
γ(Borrowed(b))` (runtime-dependent); `γ(⊥) = ∅`. `α` is the pointwise best abstraction. Obligation:
`γ` is monotone w.r.t. `refines` and `⊔` is its sound join — *straightforward from (1); to write.*

**(4) Local soundness of the transfer — DISCHARGED for the over-free property (given the O-\* rules).**
The property the over-free check needs is **no false `Owned`**: wherever the fixpoint reports
`st(v)=Owned` at a site the check trusts (a free, a return), `v` genuinely owns a store there — and a
non-`Owned` fact authorizes no free. This is *weaker* than full `σ'∈γ(f)` (a `Borrowed`-where-owned
fact is a leak-direction imprecision, out of scope) and is exactly what obligation (2) defines as
over-free. The transfer (`ownership_dataflow`) is per-var — `st'[var]=f(rhs,st)` — so prove per RHS
shape that `f=Owned ⇒ owns'(var)=var`, and that a non-`Owned` `f` authorizes no free:

- **(a) `OpDatabase(var,…)` / a record `OpNewRecord` → `Owned`.** heap.md `alloc` mints a FRESH store;
  **O-Owner** ⇒ its unique owner is `var`. `owns'(var)=var`. ∎ *(independent)*
- **(b) projection `OpGet*(base,…)` → `Borrowed(root)`.** A non-`Owned` fact — authorizes no free; and
  it correctly names the view's owner (`borrow_base`'s root, **O-Borrow**). ∎ *(independent)*
- **(c) bare `var = u` → `st[u]`.** When `st[u]=Owned`, `u` owns a store, and `var=u` — a MOVE, or a
  non-move alias materialised as `OpCopyRecord` (a/e) — leaves `var` owning one either way, so
  `owns'(var)=var`. When `st[u]` is `Borrowed`/`Join`, `f` authorizes no free. The
  `unwrap_or_else(ownership_of)` boundary (`u` absent — a parameter) yields `Borrowed(u)`, non-`Owned`.
  ∎ *(the `Owned` sub-case is independent; see the bridged gap below for the moved SOURCE)*
- **(c′) bare `var = u` where `var` is `OpDatabase`-re-minted on some path → `Owned`** (the `reminted`
  rule, taking precedence over (c)). If `var` is the arg-0 of an `OpDatabase` anywhere in the body then
  **O-Owner** gives `var` a fresh store on that path, so `var` is a materialised OWNED local; a
  whole-value `var = u` copy into it is a materialised copy (`OpCopyRecord` at codegen, as a/e) that
  owns a fresh store — `owns'(var)=var`. NARROW by construction: it fires ONLY for a bare `Var` RHS,
  never a projection (a `OpGet*` view stays `Borrowed(root)` per (b)), so no borrowing view is
  manufactured `Owned` — the property that keeps the A1b returned-view catch intact. ∎ *(independent —
  rests on O-Owner + the C86 copy-materialisation, like (c)'s `Owned` sub-case)*
- **(d) non-native call `var = f(args)` → `call_own`.** `f=Owned` only when the callee
  `return_ownership` is `Owned` = *returns a fresh store* (**O-Move**), so `owns'(var)=var`; a
  `Borrowed(argᵢ)` return authorizes no free. Sound by induction over the call graph — the callee
  summary is (4) applied to `f`; the recursion back-edge is `Borrowed(⊤)`, never `Owned`, so no false
  `Owned` is manufactured. ∎ *(inductive over the call graph)*
- **(e) else.** Record → `Owned` (fresh, O-Owner). Scalar/literal → `Owned`, but it owns no heap store,
  so a "free" of it is a no-op — no over-free. Native op → `call_ownership` (as d). ∎
- **(f) `= null` skip.** No store minted; a free of a null DbRef is a no-op. ∎ *(independent)*
- **(g) self-borrow `Borrowed(var) → Owned`.** The @P302 self-dep `[s]` is an ownership marker (re-init
  in place), not a borrow — **O-Owner** ⇒ `owns(s)=s`, so `Owned` is correct. ∎ *(independent)*
- **(h) the meet `IN[b] = ⊔ₚ OUT[p]`.** `IN=Owned` **only if every** predecessor's `OUT=Owned`
  (`Owned⊔Borrowed=Join`, not `Owned`), so `owns=var` on every incoming path — no false `Owned` from a
  join. **O-Complete**: no arm is dropped. ∎ *(independent, from (3)'s sound join)*

**The one bridged gap (the over-reach guard — honest).** `OFact` has no `Moved` state, and the
transfer does NOT kill a moved-out *source*: after `var = u` (a move), `u`'s fact stays `Owned` though
`u` no longer owns its store. So the FACT is not a full sound abstraction for moved sources. The CHECK
is over-free-sound anyway, because **O-Move** forbids the shipped plan from *freeing* a moved source —
the sole site where the stale `u=Owned` could authorize a bad free never arises. This, plus the
interprocedural induction (d), is where the over-free guarantee rests on the O-\* rules rather than the
fact alone; the INDEPENDENT part is the flow-sensitive structure — the meet, the structural-op
classification, the self-borrow/null carve-outs. A disagreement in the rule-relative cases is exactly
what the shadow-diff (Check A) surfaces — which is why the two run beside forever.

**(5) Fixpoint soundness — from (1)+(4), DISCHARGED.** The round-robin least fixpoint over the CFG
converges (**≤ n+2** passes, asserted SI-3), and by (4)'s local soundness + monotonicity + Tarski, the
per-block OUT-state soundly over-approximates the concrete ownership at every reachable point (given
the O-\* rules). *Bound, convergence, and — with (4) now discharged — the soundness step all hold.*

**(6) The check corollary.** With (5): if the oracle's check is **GREEN** — Check B finds no
unconditional `OpFreeRef(v)` with `st(v) = Borrowed`, and Check A finds no fact the shipped analysis
disagrees with in the unsound direction — then the emitted plan performs **no over-free** of the
covered classes. Contrapositive is the A1b catch: the `LOFT_NO_A1B` plan returns a store the fact
reads `Join`/`Borrowed` while the shipped fact reads `Owned` → RED (verified end-to-end,
`tests/ownership_oracle.rs`), a wrong plan every runtime gate passes.

**(7) Coexistence conclusion.** The proven oracle is a machine-checked *certifier*: on every program
where oracle and shipped analysis agree (empirically: 505-corpus + 54-cell fuzzer + 377 scripts, all
0 RED), the program carries a proof-backed over-free-freedom certificate; a residual disagreement
indicts one side for adjudication. This upgrades the register's *"validated"* to *"the flow-sensitive
fact is over-free-sound given the O-\* rules; the shipped analysis is certified per-program by the
proven oracle running beside it."*

**Obligation ledger.** DISCHARGED: (1) lattice; (3) `γ` sound-join (used in 4h); **(4) local transfer
soundness for the over-free property (the substantive lemma) — proved case by case above; the
flow-sensitive structure (4a,b,f,g,h) independently, the interprocedural summary (4d) by induction,
and the one moved-source staleness bridged by O-Move**; (5) fixpoint bound/convergence (SI-3) +
soundness step; (6) the check corollary; backend fact-identity (SI-2, `tests/ownership_oracle.rs`);
no-crying-wolf at corpus + fuzz scale (empirical). REMAINING (rigour polish, not a gap): a
machine-checked (Coq/Lean) rendering of this prose — the argument is complete but hand-written. OUT OF
SCOPE: no-leak (under-free — the leak detector's + the `check-leak` scan's class); the `Join`
runtime-witness discharge (a separate `OpFreeRefIfDistinct` lemma); proving the shipped 8-mechanism
analysis directly (the certifier sidesteps it).

## Conformance

This area's "falsifying programs" are the store-lifetime bugs themselves — each is a
program where the derived-free invariant (O-Derived) or completeness (O-Complete) fails
and a store leaks, double-frees, or a backend diverges. The area is **formal when OPEN
reaches 0**: when every store-lifetime decision is one `deps` read (O-Deps) over a complete,
typed fact, the bug class is closed by construction and `binding.md`/`types.md`'s
`deps`-fused rough spots (the `Deps`-in-`Type` fusion) resolve with it.
