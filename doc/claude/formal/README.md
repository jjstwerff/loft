# formal/ — loft's strict formal definition (rules + tracked deviations)

This directory is the **strict** formal definition of loft. Each document covers one
area and has exactly two parts:

1. **Rules** — the formal definition we *want*: the judgments / relations / grammar
   loft is meant to satisfy, written tightly enough to be checked against. This is the
   **target**, not a description of today's code.
2. **Deviations** — every place the *current implementation* breaks a rule above,
   numbered (`D1`, `D2`, …), each with: the rule it violates, where it lives, the
   user-visible effect, and a status. **The deviation list is meant to shrink to
   zero over time** — closing a deviation means making the implementation obey the
   rule (often a bug fix or a refactor), then deleting its entry here.

> **The rules do not change to match the code. The code changes to match the rules.**
> A new edge that the rules can't express is a signal the *rule* is wrong (fix the
> rule); a place the code disobeys a sound rule is a *deviation* (fix the code).

## Relationship to the working docs

These formal docs are **new and separate**; the existing planning/analysis docs are
unchanged and stay where they are:

| doc | role |
|---|---|
| [FORMALIZATION.md](../FORMALIZATION.md) | the **lens** — why formalizing is worth it, per-layer readiness, ranked rough spots |
| [TYPING_RELATION.md](../TYPING_RELATION.md) | the **analysis** of the type/conversion area — rough spots R1–R3, recommendations |
| [STABILITY_REDFLAGS.md](../STABILITY_REDFLAGS.md), [OWNERSHIP_MODEL.md](../OWNERSHIP_MODEL.md), … | the runtime/ownership working records |
| **`formal/*` (here)** | the **strict spec** — the rules, and the deviation list to drive to zero |

The lens docs answer *"is this worth doing and where does it hurt?"*; these answer
*"what exactly is the rule, and which lines break it?"* They cite each other but do
not duplicate: a deviation entry links to the lens analysis instead of re-explaining it.

## Areas

| doc | area | status |
|---|---|---|
| [types.md](types.md) | type system + conversion relation (incl. integer width) | **started** |
| [binding.md](binding.md) | reference types & `&` (the bind-site link law) | **started** — `&` is a TYPE ANNOTATION (`&τ` reference type carried by the variable), not an operator; 7 deviations = the @PLN87 ladder + the model gap |
| grammar.md | concrete grammar + operator precedence | todo (rough spot #4) |
| operational.md | small-step semantics for the stable core | todo (rough spot #3) |
| ownership.md | the `deps` / borrow **checker** (lifetimes) — distinct from binding.md's surface | **deferred** — until @PLN85 / @PLN87 close ([FORMALIZATION.md](../FORMALIZATION.md) § Recommendation); a checker over a still-moving type is premature |

## Deviation entry format

```
### Dn — <one-line name>
- **Violates:** <rule id(s)>
- **Where:** <file:symbol> (the site(s) that break it)
- **Effect:** <user-visible symptom / issue refs>
- **Status:** OPEN | IN PROGRESS (<branch/PR>) | CLOSED (<commit> — then delete)
- **Removal:** <the change that makes the code obey the rule>
```

A CLOSED deviation is **deleted**, not kept — `git log` is the history. The count of
OPEN deviations per doc is the area's distance from formal.
