# formal/types.md — type system & conversion relation (strict)

## Notation

- `Γ` — typing context (variable ⟼ type bindings).
- `τ, σ` — types (the `Type` enum, `src/data.rs`).
- `&τ` — a **reference type**: the type of a variable that is a live link to a τ-lvalue
  (read/write-through). A type constructor; its introduction and link semantics live in
  [binding.md](binding.md). In *this* doc it appears only in the conversion relation —
  it reads through to its referent (`C-Ref`).
- `Integer[a,b]` — an integer type with closed value range `[a, b]` (the `IntegerSpec`
  min/max). `integer` = `Integer[i64::MIN, i64::MAX]`; `u8` = `Integer[0, 255]`; etc.
- `τ ⤳ σ` — **conversion**: a value of `τ` is accepted where `σ` is expected, with no
  explicit cast. This is the *only* implicit coercion in the language.
- `⊔` — the **join** (least type containing both); for integers, the range-union's
  enclosing `Integer[min a c, max b d]`.

## Rules

### Judgments — bidirectional, two modes only

```
  (T-Syn)   Γ ⊢ e ⇒ τ        e synthesises its own type τ
  (T-Chk)   Γ ⊢ e ⇐ τ        e is checked against an expected τ
  (T-Sub)   Γ ⊢ e ⇒ τ ,  τ ⤳ σ   ⟹   Γ ⊢ e ⇐ σ
```

**In words.** loft works out a type in one of two directions: either the expression tells
us its type (`⇒`, *synthesis*), or the surrounding code already expects a type and we
check the expression against it (`⇐`, *checking*). `(T-Chk)` is the **single** carrier of
"the expected type" — there is exactly one checking mode, pushed structurally into
sub-expressions (literals, lambda bodies, variant references, read targets). There is no
other channel for an expected type.

```
  (T-Chk-Vec)    Γ ⊢ [e₁ … eₙ] ⇐ vector<τ>   ⟸   ∀i. Γ ⊢ eᵢ ⇐ τ
  (T-Chk-Lam)    Γ ⊢ (\x.e) ⇐ fn(σ)→τ         ⟸   Γ, x:σ ⊢ e ⇐ τ
  (T-Chk-Var)    Γ ⊢ V ⇐ Enum E               ⟸   V ∈ variants(E)
```

### Conversion `τ ⤳ σ` — width folded in

```
  (C-Refl)    τ ⤳ τ
  (C-Never)   Never ⤳ τ
  (C-Tuple)   (σ₁…σₙ) ⤳ (τ₁…τₙ)        ⟸   ∀i. σᵢ ⤳ τᵢ
  (C-Var)     Reference(S) ⤳ Enum(E)   ⟸   S ∈ variants(E)            (and the
              dual Enum(__nullable<S>) ⤳ Reference(S), and plain Enum ⤳ Integer tag)
  (C-Int)     Integer[a,b] ⤳ Integer[c,d]   ⟸   [a,b] ⊆ [c,d]         (see I-*)
  (C-Ref)     &τ ⤳ σ   ⟸   τ ⤳ σ      (a reference reads through to its referent; there
              is NO  σ ⤳ &τ  — a reference is made only by `&` at a binding, never coerced)
```

**In words.** `τ ⤳ σ` is loft's *only* automatic conversion — "a `τ` value is fine where a
`σ` is wanted, no cast needed." The rules list the safe cases: the same type; a `Never`
(a `return`/`break`, which fits anywhere); tuples element-by-element; a struct used as one
of an enum's variants (and the nullable/tag duals); and an integer into a *wider* integer.
`(C-Int)` means **width lives inside `⤳`**: an integer flows into another integer iff its
range fits. There is no separate width authority. `is_equal` answers only the *width-free*
base-type question ("is this `integer`?" — correctly *yes* for every width); `convert` and
codegen read width from this one relation, never their own copy (see the integer model
below). `(C-Ref)` threads in
references: a `&τ` variable *has* type `&τ` and reads **through** to a `τ`, so it is
usable wherever a `τ` is, and `τ`'s own conversions then apply (e.g. `&u8` → `integer`).
The reverse never holds — you cannot coerce a plain value into a reference; a `&τ` is made
only by a `&` annotation at a binding. The link's introduction and its write-through
semantics live in [binding.md](binding.md); here it is just one more thing `⤳` accepts.

### The integer model — one type; the rest is notation

> **`integer` is the only integer type.** Its identity is its value range `[min, max]`
> (plus `not_null`). `u8` / `i8` / `u16` / `i16` / `i32` are **not** distinct types — they
> are **notation** for an `integer` whose range fits in fewer than 8 bytes. The value

> ⟹ 8. `IntegerSpec.forced_size` is a **cache of that function**, not an independent fact:
> it must always equal `bytes_for_range(min, max)`. It is a storage hint, not a value-type

> Narrowing now decides by range containment (`is_narrowing_int`), in agreement with
> codegen's `narrow_int_cast` — so signedness is visible and the old split is closed. The
> one residual (D2) is that the *full integer* is still marked by `forced_size = None`,

### Integer width

```
  (I-Sub)     Integer[a,b] <: Integer[c,d]   ⟺   [a,b] ⊆ [c,d]
              and  <:  is exactly the implicit  ⤳  on integers (C-Int).
  (I-Widen)   widening (a superset target) is implicit.
  (I-Narrow)  narrowing (a non-superset target) is NOT implicit: it needs either
                – an explicit  e as σ , or
                – e is a literal whose value ∈ range(σ).
  (I-Lit)     an integer literal n  has every type Integer[a,b] with a ≤ n ≤ b
              (it checks at the expected width; it does not force i64).
  (I-Join)    a variable assigned e₁ … eₙ in a scope has type  ⨆ᵢ τᵢ  where τᵢ are the
              synthesised assignment types.  (Its width is the join of all writes,
              never just the first/narrowest.)
```

**In words.** An integer's type is its value *range*. A narrower integer fits a wider one
for free (`u8` flows into `integer`); the other way round (wider into narrower) needs an
explicit `as`, unless the value is a literal that plainly fits. A literal takes whatever
width is expected of it. And a variable written in several places gets the type big enough
for *all* its writes (the join) — not just its first one. That last point was the
#433-residual; `(I-Join)` is now implemented for inferred locals (an inferred local widens
to the join when a write would not fit; an annotated `x: u8` stays constrained), guarded by
`tests/scripts/433-ijoin-multiply-assigned.loft`.

### Coercion closure

```
  (C-Only)    ⤳ is the only implicit coercion.  Every other type change is an explicit
              op or cast and appears in the syntax.
```

## Deviations

OPEN: **2**

### D1 — four expected-type side-channels instead of one checking judgment
- **Violates:** T-Chk (and its T-Chk-* instances)
- **Where:** `src/parser/mod.rs` — `Parser.lambda_hint`, `Parser.enum_hint`,
  `Parser.read_target_type`, `Parser.vector_hint`
- **Effect:** the checking mode is hand-threaded per syntactic position; a position
  nobody wired is the next #432 (the `vector_hint` channel was literally added *as*
  the #432 fix). See [../TYPING_RELATION.md](../TYPING_RELATION.md) § R1.
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Removal:** thread a single `expected: Option<Type>` (the `⇐` mode) through the
  expression parser; delete the four fields.

### D2 — the full integer is marked by `forced_size = None`, not a canonical maximal range
- **Violates:** the integer model (width should be the range alone)
- **Where:** `is_narrowing_int` (`src/parser/mod.rs`) now decides narrowing by **range
  containment** for a forced (narrow) target — the same range+sign test codegen's
  `narrow_int_cast` uses, so the two agree (this closed the old D3/D5). But it must still
  treat `forced_size = None` as "full integer → never narrows": `IntegerSpec`'s i32/u32
  bounds cannot represent the i64 range, and the full integer has several bound encodings
  (`signed32` max = i32::MAX, `wide` max = u32::MAX), so pure containment flags false
  narrowings there. `forced_size = None` is thus still a width *marker*, not a pure range
  fact. See [../TYPING_RELATION.md](../TYPING_RELATION.md) § R2.
- **Effect:** width is range-driven for narrow types — signedness is now correct (`i8` does
  not implicitly fit `u8`) and the parser agrees with codegen. The one residual: "is this
  the full integer?" rides on `forced_size`, not on the bounds. Guard:
  `d2_signed_narrowing_i8_to_u8_needs_cast` (tests/issues.rs).
- **Status:** OPEN — the residual after the D3/D5 close.
- **Removal:** the trigger is `IntegerSpec` **i64 bounds** (`min`/`max` → i64) so
  `[a,b] ⊆ [c,d]` alone decides narrowing and `forced_size` is purely a storage cache. The
  real scope, though, is **migrating the narrow-storage layer off i32** — i64 bounds ripple
  into ~36 sites that assume i32:
  - `Parts::Byte(i32, …)` / `Parts::Short(i32, …)` — the DB storage-type enum holds the min.
  - `Value::Int(i32)` — the IR integer node.
  - `byte()` / `short()` / `int()` storage ops (`min: i32`, stored into `Parts`).
  - `usable_min` / `usable_max` — return i32.
  - `range()` needs i128 (the full-i64 count overflows i64); the `is_wide` / `*_template`
    predicates compare against the bound literals (`u32::MAX` → `i64::MAX`, etc.).

  Most ripple sites are **narrow-gated** (`forced == Some(n)`, element width 1/2/4) so the
  i64→i32 cast is safe. The **hazard** sites are `usable_min`/`usable_max` on a possibly-wide
  spec and the parser range checks — there an i64→i32 cast would *silently truncate* a wide
  bound, so widen those to i64 rather than cast. Do it as one focused pass (matrix + both
  backends + full suite), not piecemeal — a silent truncation here corrupts narrow-field
  storage (the class `range_to_width`'s comment already documents).

## Conformance check (how we know a deviation is real)

Each deviation should have a falsifying program — the case where obeying the rule and
obeying the code disagree. Examples on record:

- **D1:** `fn f(b: vector<u8>) -> integer { return (b[1] ?? 99); }` — interp obeys the
  rules, `--native` (pre-fix) obeyed the code and E0308'd. (#432, #433.)
- **D4 (CLOSED):** the cbor `read_value` cross-branch `arg` (`arg=bytes[i];
  arg=arg*256+…`) inferred `u8` and overflowed. `(I-Join)` now widens it; the falsifier
  graduated to `tests/scripts/433-ijoin-multiply-assigned.loft`.

When a deviation closes, its falsifying program graduates to `tests/scripts/` and the
entry here is deleted.
