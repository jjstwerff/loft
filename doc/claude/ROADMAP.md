# Roadmap

Items in expected implementation order, grouped by milestone.
Full descriptions and fix paths: [PLANNING.md](PLANNING.md).

**Project goal:** browser games that anyone can play via a shared link.
Native OpenGL is supported for desktop enthusiasts.  Server/multiplayer
comes after the single-player browser experience works.

## Milestone narrative

| Version | Headline                                       |
|---------|------------------------------------------------|
| 0.8.4   | **Awesome Brick Buster** — a game worth sharing    |
| 0.8.5   | **Working Moros editor** — paint hex scenes in the browser |
| 0.9.0   | **Fully working loft language** — feature-complete + verified |
| 1.0.0   | **Totally sure everything works** — IDE + multiplayer + stability contract |

**Effort:** XS = Tiny · S = Small · M = Medium · MH = Med–High · H = High · VH = Very High

**Design:** ✓ = detailed design in place · ~ = partial/outline · — = needs design

**Maintenance rule:** When an item is completed, remove it from this file.
Completed work belongs in CHANGELOG.md and git history.

## 0.8.4 — Awesome Brick Buster

**Goal:** ship a Brick Buster game that is fun to play, not just a tech demo. The
current `lib/graphics/examples/25-brick-buster.loft` already has multi-hit bricks,
pickups, particles, combos, multi-ball, level transitions, and a sprite
atlas (G1/G2). 0.8.4 turns it from "playable proof of concept" into
"a game someone would actually want to share with a friend."

### What "awesome" means

| Area      | Today                          | After 0.8.4                                  |
|-----------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Audio     | ~~Silent~~ | **Done** — chiptune synthesis (sfx_beep/chirp/noise/descend/bounce) |
| Levels    | Procedurally generated rows    | Several hand-designed levels with themes     |
| Visuals   | Procedural sprite atlas        | Polished art + screen shake + better particles |
| Sharing   | ~~Run from `cargo run …`~~ | **Done** — `loft --html` single-file export (native WASM) |
| Smoothness| ~~Per-frame store leak workarounds~~ | **Done** — P122 fixed; idiomatic struct APIs work |

### Game infrastructure

| ID    | Title                                                  | E  | Status |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------|----|--------|
| G3    | Tilemap rendering (grid-based 2D, batched draw)        | M  | Partial — the brick grid + `level_brick(lv,r,c)` dispatcher in Brick Buster is the tilemap for that game; a generic `lib/tilemap` package is still open. |
| ~~G5~~| ~~Audio: sound effect playback~~                       | S  | **Done** — rodio + audio_play_raw + chiptune synthesis |
| ~~G6~~| ~~Audio: background music with crossfade~~             | S  | **Done** — three-track rotating playlist with inter-track silence |
| ~~W1.1~~| ~~Single-file HTML export~~                          | M  | **Done** — native WASM + asyncify + GL bridge |
| G7.P  | 🌐 **Playable Brick Buster** — share link on itch.io        | S  | Ready (--html works) |

### Game polish (`lib/graphics/examples/25-brick-buster.loft`)

| ID    | Title                                                  | E  | Status |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------|----|--------|
| ~~BK.1~~ | ~~Audio integration~~                              | S  | **Done** — brick/paddle/wall/pickup/life sounds |
| ~~BK.2~~ | ~~Background music~~                               | S  | **Done** — 3 early-Capcom tracks (Heroic / Determined / Calm) rotating with 4-s silences |
| ~~BK.3~~ | ~~Hand-designed levels (5+)~~                      | M  | **Done** — 5 layouts via `level_brick` dispatcher, procedural fallback at 6+ |
| ~~BK.4~~ | ~~Screen shake on brick break + life lost~~        | XS | **Done** — `br_shake_t/mag` applied via painter projection matrix |
| ~~BK.5~~ | ~~Pause menu + restart~~                           | S  | **Done** — P to pause, SPACE to resume |
| ~~BK.6~~ | ~~Title screen + game-over screen~~                | S  | **Done** — state machine with restart |
| ~~BK.7~~ | ~~High-score persistence~~                         | S  | **Done** — `.loft/brickbuster_score.txt` + `HI <n>` HUD row |
| ~~BK.8~~ | ~~Sprite-atlas polish pass~~                       | S  | **Done** — cel-shaded outlines, round ball with velocity-directional squash, hearts, Roman-numeral levels, balloon projectile, fireball after-images |

### Language fixes (all completed)

All language blockers for 0.8.4 are resolved:
- **P117–P131** — fixed and verified (store leaks, slot allocation, native codegen,
  CLI args, headless GL safety). See PROBLEMS.md § Fixed.
- **L4** — compile error for literal passed to `&` parameter.
- **L5/L6/S5** — confirmed already fixed.
- **Bytecode cache** — `build.rs` adds git commit hash; rebuilds invalidate stale `.loftc`.

Brick Buster's raw-float workarounds (bitmasks, `aabb_depth_x/y`) can now be replaced
with idiomatic struct-based APIs.

## 0.8.5 — Working Moros editor

**Goal:** the Moros hex RPG scene editor runs end-to-end in the browser:
load a map, paint hexes, place walls and items, see a live 3D preview,
export to GLB. Web only — multiplayer comes in 1.0.0.

Design: `../moros/doc/claude/`

### Must-fix blockers (share the Moros editor's code paths)

|-------|--------------------------------------------------------|----|----------------|
| P137  | `loft --html` Brick Buster runtime `unreachable` panic — browser WASM wedges on first `loft_start` call. Blocks every WASM-shipped loft program, Moros editor included | M | PROBLEMS.md #137 |
| P135  | Canvas Y-flip is a three-way compensation — off-by-ones 2×N sprite atlases. **Decision:** normalise to screen-top-left `(0,0)` throughout, remove upload-side row reversal, re-bake the one atlas (Brick Buster) that depended on the previous convention | S | PROBLEMS.md #135, CAVEATS.md C58 |

## 0.9.0 — Fully working loft language

**Goal:** the language itself is feature-complete, well-documented, and
tooling-friendly. No "appears fixed but unverified" bugs in PROBLEMS.md.
Anyone can write loft code in their preferred editor with syntax
highlighting, decent error messages, and a REPL for experimentation.

### Language polish

| ID     | Title                                                  | E  | Design | Source           |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------|----|--------|------------------|
| L1     | Error recovery after token failures                    | M  | ✓      | PLANNING.md      |
| P2     | REPL / interactive mode                                | M  | ✓      | PLANNING.md      |
| W-warn | Developer warnings (Clippy-inspired)                   | M  | ✓      | GAME_INFRA.md    |
| AOT    | Auto-compile libraries to native shared libs           | M  | ✓      | PLANNING.md      |
| C52    | Stdlib name clash: warning + `std::` prefix            | M  | ✓      | PLANNING.md      |
| C53    | Match arms: library enums + bare variant names         | M  | ✓      | PLANNING.md      |

### User-biting caveats — all ship in 0.9.0

Each of these is a commitment, not a maybe.  Deferring any of them
makes the "fully working language" label dishonest.

| ID     | Title                                                  | E  | Source |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------|----|--------|
| C60    | **Hash iteration.** Adopt the I13 iterator protocol so `for (k, v) in hash` works (unspecified order, like Python/Rust). Removes a top-level collection-promise gap | M | CAVEATS.md, SERVER_FEATURES.md I13 |
| C61.local | **Outer-local shadow diagnostic.** Reject `x = 5; for x in …` only when the outer `x` has a live read after the loop — needs post-parse liveness info. Infrastructure (`Variable::was_loop_var`) already landed; add the liveness pass and flip the reject | S | CAVEATS.md |
| C54    | **`i32::MIN` null sentinel.** Emit a compiler warning when `integer` is used for arithmetic likely to land on the sentinel (multiplicative code, sums over large vectors). Teach users to reach for `long` | S | CAVEATS.md |
| P22    | **Remove `spacial<T>` keyword.** A reserved word that always errors is user-hostile. Drop it from the parser/type system until A4 actually implements the backing tree (1.1+) | XS | PROBLEMS.md #22 |
| P54    | **`JsonValue` enum.** Replace opaque `vector<text>` returned by `json_items` with a typed enum (Object / Array / String / Number / Boolean / Null) | MH | PROBLEMS.md #54 |
| P91    | **`init(expr)` parameter defaults referencing earlier args.** `fn make_rect(w: integer, h: integer = w)` should parse | S | PROBLEMS.md #91 |

**Shipped in earlier 0.8.x** (kept here for CHANGELOG readers; delete on 0.9.0 sweep):
- ~~C61-nested~~ — parse-time reject for `for i { for i { } }` (`tests/parse_errors.rs::c61_nested_same_name_loop_rejected`)
- ~~P86~~ — real closures; regression guards in `tests/issues.rs` and `tests/parse_errors.rs`
- ~~P138~~ — `loft --native` prints actionable hint on E0460 + rand_core

### Compilation cache and constant store

The `.loftc` bytecode cache and `CONST_STORE` are implemented (Phase A + D).
Remaining work must land in 0.9.0 to avoid stability risk in later milestones.
Design: [CONST_STORE.md](CONST_STORE.md).

| ID     | Title                                                  | E  | Design | Source           |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------|----|--------|------------------|
| CS.B   | mmap cache loading (native)                            | S  | ✓      | CONST_STORE.md   |
| CS.C1  | Serialize `Data` struct to binary                      | MH | ~      | CONST_STORE.md   |
| CS.C2  | `build.rs` pre-compile stdlib to `.loftc`              | M  | ✓      | CONST_STORE.md   |
| CS.C3  | WASM: `include_bytes!` stdlib cache, skip re-parse     | S  | ✓      | CONST_STORE.md   |

CS.B becomes worthwhile after CS.C2 produces a larger cache file. CS.C1 is
the prerequisite for CS.C2/C3 — it requires serializing `Definition`,
`Value`, `Type`, `Attribute`, and `Function` (recursive enums, ~2K lines
in `data.rs`). Hand-written binary serialization preferred over serde to
avoid adding serde to the default feature set.

These were closed during today's release-mode push but belong to the
language-polish narrative.

## 1.0.0 — Totally sure everything works

**Goal:** the stability contract. Anyone can write, run, and share a
program — terminal or browser — and trust that it will keep working.
Ship the IDE, ship multiplayer, and prove the language is bulletproof
with hands-on testing on every supported platform.

### Stability gate (no shortcuts)

The 1.0.0 stability contract requires every item below to be checked off
before tagging — no "appears fixed" exceptions.

- [ ] **PROBLEMS.md** has zero open `**High**` severity entries
- [ ] All `⚠️ Appears fixed but unverified` flags from 0.9.0 have been
      definitively closed via real-world testing (not just regression guards)
- [ ] **valgrind clean** on a debug build of `tests/scripts/50-tuples.loft`
      and the full brick-buster game (`25-brick-buster.loft`) for 5+ minutes of play
- [ ] `make ci` green on Linux, macOS Intel, macOS ARM, Windows
- [ ] All `~~Fixed~~` PROBLEMS.md entries removed (history lives in CHANGELOG.md)
- [ ] `doc/claude/INCONSISTENCIES.md` reviewed: each entry resolved or
      explicitly accepted in LOFT.md / CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Pre-built binaries on the GitHub release for all four platforms
- [ ] HTML reference and PDF up to date and linked from the release page
