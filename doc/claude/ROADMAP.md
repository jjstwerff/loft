# Roadmap

## Roadmap vs. release plan

This file is the **wish list**: items we want to do, ordered by
when they fit best into the project's arc.  Not every roadmap
item blocks a release — many can slip from one milestone to the
next without holding up a ship.

The companion file [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md) answers a narrower
question: "what MUST be true before we tag and publish?"  When a
roadmap item is also a release blocker, it gets echoed into
RELEASE.md's gate lists.

| File | Scope | Question it answers |
|---|---|---|
| **ROADMAP.md** (this file) | Things we'd like to do | "What's the arc of work, and in what order?" |
| **[RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md)** | Ship checklist | "What must be true before we can publish?" |
| **[PLANNING.md](PLANNING.md)** | Priority-ordered backlog | "What's the next best thing to pick up?" |

Items in expected implementation order, grouped by milestone.
Full descriptions and fix paths: [PLANNING.md](PLANNING.md).

**Project goal:** browser games that anyone can play via a shared link.
Native OpenGL is supported for desktop enthusiasts.  Server/multiplayer
comes after the single-player browser experience works.

## Milestone narrative

## 0.8.4 — Awesome Brick Buster

**Goal:** ship a Brick Buster game that is fun to play, not just a tech demo. The
current `lib/graphics/examples/25-brick-buster.loft` already has multi-hit bricks,
pickups, particles, combos, multi-ball, level transitions, and a sprite
atlas (G1/G2). 0.8.4 turns it from "playable proof of concept" into
"a game someone would actually want to share with a friend."

### What "awesome" means

| Area      | Today                          | After 0.8.4                                  |
|-----------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Audio     | ~~Silent~~ | **Done** — chiptune synthesis (sfx_beep/chirp/noise/descend/bounce) |
| Levels    | Procedurally generated rows    | Several hand-designed levels with themes     |
| Visuals   | Procedural sprite atlas        | Polished art + screen shake + better particles |
| Sharing   | ~~Run from `cargo run …`~~ | **Done** — `loft --html` single-file export (native WASM) |
| Smoothness| ~~Per-frame store leak workarounds~~ | **Done** — P122 fixed; idiomatic struct APIs work |

### Game infrastructure

| ID    | Title                                                  | E  | Status |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------|----|--------|
| G3    | Tilemap rendering (grid-based 2D, batched draw)        | M  | Partial — the brick grid + `level_brick(lv,r,c)` dispatcher in Brick Buster is the tilemap for that game; a generic `lib/tilemap` package is still open. |
| ~~G5~~| ~~Audio: sound effect playback~~                       | S  | **Done** — rodio + audio_play_raw + chiptune synthesis |
| ~~G6~~| ~~Audio: background music with crossfade~~             | S  | **Done** — three-track rotating playlist with inter-track silence |
| ~~W1.1~~| ~~Single-file HTML export~~                          | M  | **Done** — native WASM + asyncify + GL bridge |
| G7.P  | 🌐 **Playable Brick Buster** — share link on itch.io        | S  | Ready (--html works) |

### Game polish (`lib/graphics/examples/25-brick-buster.loft`)

| ID    | Title                                                  | E  | Status |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------|----|--------|
| ~~BK.1~~ | ~~Audio integration~~                              | S  | **Done** — brick/paddle/wall/pickup/life sounds |
| ~~BK.2~~ | ~~Background music~~                               | S  | **Done** — 3 early-Capcom tracks (Heroic / Determined / Calm) rotating with 4-s silences |
| ~~BK.3~~ | ~~Hand-designed levels (5+)~~                      | M  | **Done** — 5 layouts via `level_brick` dispatcher, procedural fallback at 6+ |
| ~~BK.4~~ | ~~Screen shake on brick break + life lost~~        | XS | **Done** — `br_shake_t/mag` applied via painter projection matrix |
| ~~BK.5~~ | ~~Pause menu + restart~~                           | S  | **Done** — P to pause, SPACE to resume |
| ~~BK.6~~ | ~~Title screen + game-over screen~~                | S  | **Done** — state machine with restart |
| ~~BK.7~~ | ~~High-score persistence~~                         | S  | **Done** — `.loft/brickbuster_score.txt` + `HI <n>` HUD row |
| ~~BK.8~~ | ~~Sprite-atlas polish pass~~                       | S  | **Done** — cel-shaded outlines, round ball with velocity-directional squash, hearts, Roman-numeral levels, balloon projectile, fireball after-images |

### Language fixes (all completed)

All language blockers for 0.8.4 are resolved:
- **P117–P131** — fixed and verified (store leaks, slot allocation, native codegen,
  CLI args, headless GL safety). See PROBLEMS.md § Fixed.
- **L4** — compile error for literal passed to `&` parameter.
- **L5/L6/S5** — confirmed already fixed.
- **Bytecode cache** — `build.rs` adds git commit hash; rebuilds invalidate stale `.loftc`.

Brick Buster's raw-float workarounds (bitmasks, `aabb_depth_x/y`) can now be replaced
with idiomatic struct-based APIs.

## 0.8.5 — Working Moros editor

**Goal:** the Moros hex RPG scene editor runs end-to-end in the browser:
load a map, paint hexes, place walls and items, see a live 3D preview,
export to GLB. Web only — multiplayer comes in 1.0.0.

Design: `../moros/doc/claude/`

**Native editor (shipped, independent of this milestone):** a standalone
OpenGL editor now also ships via
`lib/graphics/examples/moros_editor.loft` and is packaged with
`make editor-dist` into a self-contained `dist/moros-editor/` directory
that runs without `loft` on the machine.  It provides fullscreen support
(`gl_create_fullscreen_window`), scroll-wheel + expanded key codes,
panel UI overlay, and `editor_click` routing.  See
`doc/claude/plans/finished/03-native-moros-editor/README.md`.

### Must-fix blockers (share the Moros editor's code paths)

All blockers cleared; Moros editor's loft-side libraries can ship
under `--html` without browser-side wedges.

| ID    | Title                                                           | E  | Source                       |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----|------------------------------|
| ~~P137~~ | ~~`loft --html` browser WASM wedges on first `loft_start`~~ | — | **Done** — `Instant::now()` guard switched from `feature = "wasm"` to `target_arch = "wasm32"`; `host_time_now()` returns 0 on wasm32-without-wasm-feature; `n_ticks` gated identically.  Verified by `tests/html_wasm.rs` (5 regression guards). |
| ~~P135~~ | ~~Canvas Y-flip three-way compensation~~ | S | **Done** — upload flip removed + TEX_VERT_2D samples identity V; 2×2 atlas corner guard in `snap_smoke.sh`. Canonical convention locked in OPENGL.md |

## 0.9.0 — Fully working loft language

**Goal:** the language itself is feature-complete, well-documented, and
tooling-friendly. No "appears fixed but unverified" bugs in PROBLEMS.md.
Anyone can write loft code in their preferred editor with syntax
highlighting, decent error messages, and a REPL for experimentation.

**Advertising readiness**: 0.9.0 is also the gate for honestly pitching
loft to external programmers as an alternative to their current scripting
language.  Four items were added to this milestone specifically to close
that gap:

- **PKG.REG** — central registry so `loft install <name>` works.
- **DX.3** — a 30-minute narrative tutorial for newcomers.
- **DX.4** — native-mode parity in fast CI to stop P143/P171-class
  regressions from surfacing mid-release.
- **PKG.EXTRACT** — move every `lib/*/` library out of the interpreter
  repo.  Logical bundling is allowed where it fits — the five `moros_*`
  libraries naturally share one `loft-moros` repo, `server` / `web` /
  `game_protocol` share `loft-net`, `graphics` + `imaging` share
  `loft-graphics` — but `loft install <name>` still resolves at
  library granularity so users never see the bundling.  The
  interpreter repo today carries ~960 MB of library code + build
  artefacts that have nothing to do with the language itself; a
  programmer cloning `loft` to look at the interpreter shouldn't
  wait on a multi-hundred-megabyte graphics assets download.
  Healthy ecosystems separate the language from its libraries;
  loft's monorepo today is an accident of solo-maintainer convenience.

Without these, newcomers hit an "on your own" wall within an hour and
the native codegen's regressions keep slipping in.  With them, loft
has the surrounding surface a bettable language needs.

### Language polish

| C53    | Match arms: library enums + bare variant names         | M  | ✓      | PLANNING.md      |

### User-biting caveats — all ship in 0.9.0

Each of these is a commitment, not a maybe.  Deferring any of them
makes the "fully working language" label dishonest.

Step plans for both entries: [QUALITY.md](QUALITY.md).

| ID   | Title                                                                     | E  | Source                      |
|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----|-----------------------------|
| C54  | Switch `integer` from i32 to i64 — eliminates the `i32::MIN` null-sentinel trap; `long` becomes a historical alias | L  | CAVEATS.md, QUALITY.md  |
| P54  | First-class `JsonValue` enum (JObject / JArray / JString / JNumber / JBool / JNull) — `json_parse` returns it; `MyStruct.parse` accepts only `JsonValue`; old text-based `json_items` / `json_nested` / `json_long` / `json_float` / `json_bool` surface withdrawn | MH | PROBLEMS.md #54, QUALITY.md |

**Shipped in earlier 0.8.x** (kept here for CHANGELOG readers; delete on 0.9.0 sweep):
- ~~C7/P22~~ — `spacial<T>` diagnostic references 1.1+ timeline
- ~~C60~~ — hash iteration in ascending key order (`quality` branch)
- ~~C61.local~~ — outer-local shadow reject on pass 1
- ~~C61-nested~~ — parse-time reject for `for i { for i { } }`
- ~~P86~~ — real closures; regression guards in `tests/issues.rs` and `tests/parse_errors.rs`
- ~~P91~~ — default-from-earlier-parameter via call-site Var(N) substitution
- ~~P138~~ — `loft --native` prints actionable hint on E0460 + rand_core
- ~~SLOT-VEC3 / #139~~ — `OpReserveFrame` fires when slot sits above TOS

### Compilation cache and constant store

The `.loftc` bytecode cache and `CONST_STORE` are implemented (Phase A + D).
Remaining work must land in 0.9.0 to avoid stability risk in later milestones.
Design: [CONST_STORE.md](CONST_STORE.md).

| ID     | Title                                                  | E  | Design | Source           |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------|----|--------|------------------|
| CS.B   | mmap cache loading (native)                            | S  | ✓      | CONST_STORE.md   |
| CS.C1  | Serialize `Data` struct to binary                      | MH | ~      | CONST_STORE.md   |
| CS.C2  | `build.rs` pre-compile stdlib to `.loftc`              | M  | ✓      | CONST_STORE.md   |
| CS.C3  | WASM: `include_bytes!` stdlib cache, skip re-parse     | S  | ✓      | CONST_STORE.md   |

CS.B becomes worthwhile after CS.C2 produces a larger cache file. CS.C1 is
the prerequisite for CS.C2/C3 — it requires serializing `Definition`,
`Value`, `Type`, `Attribute`, and `Function` (recursive enums, ~2K lines
in `data.rs`). Hand-written binary serialization preferred over serde to
avoid adding serde to the default feature set.

### Developer experience

Complements DX.1's examples/ (reference) with a narrative path (learning).  A newcomer shouldn't have to infer the language from cold-reading examples. | S  | —      | this-session assessment |
| DX.4  | Native-mode parity in fast CI — every `tests/scripts/*.loft` and `tests/issues.rs` test runs under both `--interpret` AND `--native` via the existing `tests/native.rs` harness, wired into the GitHub Actions fast job (not just `ci-full`).  Catches P143/P144/P157/P171/P180-class native-codegen regressions before they land in main.  Today's fast CI runs `cargo nextest run --profile ci` which skips `tests/native.rs`; parity requires promoting it.  Cost: one CI job slot + longer compile cache. | S  | —      | this-session assessment |

### Package and FFI tooling

| PKG.7       | Lock file (`loft.lock`) for reproducible builds        | S  | ✓      | manifest.rs      |
| PKG.REG     | Central package registry MVP — `loft install <name>` fetches from a GitHub-hosted registry.txt; 3–5 curated first-party libraries seed the ecosystem so newcomers hit `loft install graphics` / `loft install json` and get working dependencies on day one. Previously deferred-indefinitely as A7.4 under "ecosystem must exist first"; the chicken-and-egg bites both ways — no registry, no ecosystem.  Required to credibly advertise loft to external programmers. | M  | ✓      | PACKAGES.md      |
| PKG.EXTRACT | Extract every library under `lib/*/` out of the interpreter repo and into separate GitHub projects; register each library in the PKG.REG registry so `loft install <name>` resolves at library granularity regardless of how repos are grouped.  **Logical bundling is allowed** — libraries that form a natural family can share a single repo with per-library subdirectories, as long as each exports a `loft.toml` and the registry points at the right subdir.  Expected groupings: `jjstwerff/loft-moros` (moros_editor / moros_map / moros_render / moros_sim / moros_ui — all part of the Moros editor stack); `jjstwerff/loft-net` (server + web + game_protocol — shared HTTP / WS / protocol infrastructure); `jjstwerff/loft-graphics` (graphics + imaging — both visual, the imaging library is the low-level backend graphics draws on top of); and standalone repos for the rest (`loft-crypto`, `loft-random`, `loft-arguments`, `loft-shapes`).  The `loft` repo keeps only the interpreter + compiler + stdlib core (`default/*.loft`) + language tests.  Removes ~960 MB of mostly build-artefact + asset bloat from casual clones of the interpreter (`lib/graphics` alone is 811 MB) and matches the "one language, many libraries" story that every healthy ecosystem tells.  Depends on PKG.REG for the install path, on DX.4 for the cross-repo CI story, and on FFI.1–4 for the boilerplate-free native-extension author experience.  Moves happen one bundle at a time ("extract loft-moros, land, extract loft-net, land, ...") so a failed move doesn't strand the others; the bundling choice per-family is revisable up until the extract commit. | L  | —      | PACKAGES.md      |

## 1.0.0 — Totally sure everything works

**Goal:** the stability contract. Anyone can write, run, and share a
program — terminal or browser — and trust that it will keep working.
Ship the IDE, ship multiplayer, and prove the language is bulletproof
with hands-on testing on every supported platform.

### IDE + multiplayer must-haves

### Stability gate (no shortcuts)

The 1.0.0 stability contract requires every item below to be checked off
before tagging — no "appears fixed" exceptions.

- [ ] **PROBLEMS.md** has zero open `**High**` severity entries
- [ ] All `⚠️ Appears fixed but unverified` flags from 0.9.0 have been
      definitively closed via real-world testing (not just regression guards)
- [ ] **valgrind clean** on a debug build of `tests/scripts/50-tuples.loft`
      and the full brick-buster game (`25-brick-buster.loft`) for 5+ minutes of play
- [ ] `make ci` green on Linux, macOS Intel, macOS ARM, Windows
- [ ] All `~~Fixed~~` PROBLEMS.md entries removed (history lives in CHANGELOG.md)
- [ ] `doc/claude/INCONSISTENCIES.md` reviewed: each entry resolved or
      explicitly accepted in LOFT.md / CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Pre-built binaries on the GitHub release for all four platforms
- [ ] HTML reference and PDF up to date and linked from the release page
