# Enhancement Planning

## Goals

Loft aims to be:

1. **Correct** — programs produce the right answer or a clear error, never silent wrong results.
2. **Prototype-friendly** — a new developer should be able to express an idea in loft with minimal
   ceremony: imports that don't require prefixing every name, functions that can be passed and
   called like values, concise pattern matching, and a runtime that reports errors clearly and
   exits with a meaningful code.
3. **Performant at scale** — allocation, collection lookups, and parallel execution should stay
   efficient as data grows.
4. **Architecturally clean** — the compiler and interpreter internals should be free of technical
   debt that makes future features hard to add.
5. **Developed in small, verified steps** — each feature is complete and tested before the next
   begins.  No half-implementations are shipped.  No feature is added "just in case".  Every
   release must be smaller and better than its estimate, never larger.  This is the primary
   defence against regressions and against the codebase growing beyond one person's ability to
   understand it fully.

The items below are ordered by tier: things that break programs come first, then language-quality
and prototype-friction items, then architectural work.  See [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md) for the full
release gate criteria, project structure changes, and release artifact checklist.

**Completed items are removed entirely** — this document is strictly for future work.
Completion history lives in git (commit messages and CHANGELOG.md).  Leaving "done" markers
creates noise and makes the document harder to scan for remaining work.

## Version Milestones

### Version 0.8.2 — Stability, native codegen, and slot correctness (in progress)

Goal: harden the interpreter, complete native code generation, fix slot assignment, and
improve runtime efficiency.  No new language syntax.  Most items are independent and can be developed
in parallel.

**Remaining for 0.8.2:** *(none — all items completed or deferred)*

**Deferred from 0.8.2 (too complex / disruptive for stability):**
- **O1** — Superinstruction peephole rewriting pass — deferred to 1.1+.
- **A12** — Lazy work-variable initialization — deferred to 1.1+ (also blocked by Issues 68–70).

---

### Version 0.8.3 — Language syntax extensions (planned)

Goal: add all new language syntax before the feature-complete 0.9.0 milestone so that
syntax decisions can be validated and refined independently.  All items change the parser
or type system; 0.8.2 correctness work is a prerequisite.

**Lambda expressions (P1):** ✓ completed in 0.8.2.
**Vector aggregates (P3):** `sum_of`, `min_of`, `max_of` for integers ✓ completed. Predicate aggregates (`any`, `all`, `count_if`) deferred — requires compiler special-casing for lambda-based loops.

**Generic functions (P5):**
- **P5** — First-parameter generic functions: `fn name<T>(param: T, ...)` with demand-driven instantiation.

**Pattern extensions (L2):**
- **L2** — Nested match patterns: field sub-patterns separated by `:` in struct arms.

**Remaining:**
- **A10** — Field iteration (`for f in s#fields`): 5 phases (A10.0–A10.4).

---

### Version 0.8.4 — HTTP client and JSON (planned)

Goal: add blocking HTTP client access and automatic JSON mapping so loft programs can
consume web services.  Builds on P1 lambdas (0.8.3): `Type.from_json` is a callable
fn-ref that composes naturally with `map` and `filter`.  All items gated behind a new
`http` Cargo feature so binaries that don't need networking stay lean.

**JSON struct annotation (H1):**
- **H1** — Parse `#json` before struct declarations; synthesise `to_json(self) -> text`
  reusing the existing `:j` format flag.  No new runtime dependency.

**JSON primitive stdlib (H2):**
- **H2** — Add `serde_json`-backed extraction functions: `json_text`, `json_int`,
  `json_long`, `json_float`, `json_bool`, `json_items`, `json_nested`.
  Declared in `default/04_web.loft`; implemented in new `src/native_http.rs`.

**JSON deserialization codegen — scalars (H3):**
- **H3** — For each `#json` struct with primitive fields only, synthesise
  `from_json(body: text) -> T` using the H2 primitives.  `Type.from_json` is now a
  valid fn-ref passable to `map`.

**HTTP client (H4):**
- **H4** — `HttpResponse` struct (`status: integer`, `body: text`, `ok()` method) and
  blocking HTTP functions (`http_get`, `http_post`, `http_put`, `http_delete`, plus
  `_h` variants accepting `vector<text>` headers) via `ureq`.

**Nested types and integration (H5):**
- **H5** — Extend `from_json` codegen to nested `#json` struct fields, `vector<T>` array
  fields, and plain enum fields.  Integration test suite against a mock HTTP server.

---

### Version 0.8.1 — Stability patch (2026-03-18)

Three correctness fixes — no new language features.

- **T0-11** — `addr_mut()` on a locked store now panics (replaced the silent DUMMY buffer).
- **T0-12** — `vector_add()` snapshots source bytes before resize; `v += v` is now correct.
- **T1-32** — `write_file`, `read_file`, `seek_file` log errors to stderr instead of silently discarding them.

---

### Version 0.8.0 — Released (2026-03-17)

Match expressions (enum, scalar, or-patterns, guard clauses, range patterns, null/char
patterns, struct destructuring), code formatter, wildcard imports, callable fn-refs,
map/filter/reduce, vector.clear(), mkdir, time functions, logging, parallel execution,
24+ bug fixes, comprehensive user documentation (24 pages + Safety guide + PDF).

---

### Version 0.9.0 — Production-ready standalone executable (planned)

Goal: every planned language feature is present and the interpreter ships pre-built.
Interpreter correctness and native codegen are handled by 0.8.2; new syntax by 0.8.3;
HTTP and JSON by 0.8.4; this milestone completes runtime infrastructure and tooling.

**Language completeness:**
- **L1** — Error recovery: a single bad token must not cascade into dozens of spurious errors.
- **P2** — REPL / interactive mode: `loft` with no arguments enters a persistent session.

**Parallel execution completeness:**
- **A1** — Moved to 0.8.2 (see remaining work above).

**Logging completeness:**
- **A2** — Logger remaining work: hot-reload wiring, `is_production()`/`is_debug()`, `--release` assert elision, `--debug` per-type safety logging.

**Deferred from 0.9.0:**
- O1 (superinstruction merging) — Too complex and disruptive for stability; deferred to 1.1+.
- A12 (lazy work-variable init) — Too complex and disruptive; also blocked by Issues 68–70; deferred to 1.1+.
- A5 (closure capture) — Depends on P1; very high effort; 1.1+.
- A7 (native extension libraries) — Moved to 0.9.0.

---

### Version 1.0.0 — Complete IDE + stability contract (planned)

Goal: a fully working, friendly IDE that lets users write and run loft programs in a
browser without installing anything, paired with a stable, feature-complete interpreter.

The **stability contract** — any program valid on 1.0.0 compiles and runs identically on
any 1.0.x or 1.x.0 release — covers both the language surface and the public IDE API.
Full gate criteria in [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md).

**Prerequisites:**
- **R1** — Workspace split into `loft-core` + `loft-cli` + `loft-gendoc` (enables the `cdylib` WASM target without affecting the CLI binary).

**Web IDE (W1–W6):**
- **W1** — WASM foundation: compile interpreter to WASM, expose typed JS API.
- **W2** — Editor shell: CodeMirror 6 with Loft grammar, diagnostics, toolbar.
- **W3** — Symbol navigation: go-to-definition, find-usages, outline panel.
- **W4** — Multi-file projects: IndexedDB persistence, tab bar, `use` auto-complete.
- **W5** — Documentation and examples browser: embedded HTML docs + one-click example projects.
- **W6** — Export/import ZIP + PWA: offline support, URL sharing, drag-and-drop import.

**Stability gate (same as RELEASE.md §§ 1–9):**
- All INCONSISTENCIES.md entries addressed or documented as accepted behaviour.
- Full documentation review; pre-built binaries for all four platforms; crates.io publish.

**Deferred to 1.1+:**
A5, A7, Tier N (native codegen).

---

### Version 1.x — Minor releases (additive)

New language features that are strictly backward-compatible.  Candidates: A5 (closures),
A7 (native extensions), Tier N (native codegen).

---

### Version 2.0 — Breaking changes only

Reserved for language-level breaking changes (sentinel redesign, syntax removal).
Not expected in the near term.

---

### Milestone Reevaluation

The previous plan had 1.0 as a language-stability contract for the interpreter alone,
with the Web IDE deferred indefinitely to "post-1.0".  This reevaluation changes both
milestones and adds the small-steps goal.  The reasoning:

**Why introduce 0.9.0?**
The old plan reached the current state (0.8.1) and declared "L1 is the last blocker
before 1.0", but that understated what "fully featured" actually requires.  Several items
(P1 lambdas, A9 vector CoW, A6 slot pre-pass, A8 string efficiency, A1
parallel completeness) are not optional polish — they close correctness and usability
gaps that a production-ready interpreter must not have.  A 0.9.0 milestone gives these
items a home without inflating the 1.0 scope.

**Why include the IDE in 1.0.0?**
A standalone interpreter 1.0 that is later extended with a breaking IDE integration
produces two separate stability contracts to maintain.  The Web IDE (W1–W6) is already
concretely designed in [WEB_IDE.md](WEB_IDE.md) and is bounded, testable work.  Deferring
it to "post-1.0" without a milestone risks it never shipping.  In 2026, "fully featured"
for a scripting language includes browser-accessible tooling; shipping a 1.0 without it
would require walking back that claim at 1.1.

**Why include native codegen (Tier N) in 0.8.2?**
`src/generation/` already translates the loft IR to Rust source; the code exists but
does not compile.  The N items are incremental bug fixes — each is Small or Medium effort,
independent of each other and of the other 0.8.2 items — they can be interleaved freely.
Fixing them in 0.8.2 means 0.9.0 ships a binary where `--native` actually works, at no
extra milestone cost.  Deferring them would mean shipping a 0.9.0 that silently generates
uncompilable output.

**Why include REPL (P2) in 0.9.0?**
The Web IDE covers the browser-based interactive use case, but a terminal REPL is
independently useful for development workflows where a browser is not available or
convenient.  P2 is self-contained (new `src/repl.rs`, small changes to `main.rs`)
and depends on L1 (error recovery) which is already in 0.9.0.  Including it rounds
out the "prototype-friendly" goal without affecting the IDE track.

**Why split syntax into 0.8.3?**
Lambda expressions, nested patterns, and field iteration all touch the parser and type
system simultaneously.  Grouping them in a dedicated milestone means syntax decisions can
be reviewed and refined in isolation, before runtime infrastructure work in 0.9.0 begins.
It also keeps each milestone small enough to be fully understood in a single pass.

**The small-steps principle in practice:**
Each milestone is a strict subset of the next.  0.8.2 hardens correctness; 0.8.3 adds new
syntax; 0.8.4 adds HTTP and JSON on top of lambdas; 0.9.0 completes runtime infrastructure
and tooling; 1.0.0 adds exactly R1 + W1–W6 on top of a complete 0.9.0.  No item moves
forward until the test suite for the previous item is green.  This prevents the "everything
at once" failure mode where half-finished features interact and regressions are hard to pin.

---

### Recommended Implementation Order

Ordered by unblocking impact and the small-steps principle (each item leaves the codebase
in a better state than it found it, with passing tests).

**Released as 0.8.2 (2026-03-24).**

**For 0.8.3 (after 0.8.2 is tagged):**
1. **P3** + **L2** — aggregates and nested patterns; P3 depends on P1 (done in 0.8.2); batch together
2. **P5** — generic functions; independent of P3/L2; land after data.rs changes settle
3. **A10** — field iteration; independent, medium; can land in parallel with P3

**For 0.8.4 (after 0.8.3 is tagged):**
1. **H1** — `#json` + `to_json`; Small, no new Rust deps; validates annotation parsing
2. **H2** — JSON primitive stdlib; Small–Medium, new `src/database/json.rs` (~80 lines, no new dep); test each extractor in isolation
3. **H3** — `from_json` scalar codegen; Medium, depends on H1 + H2; verify `Type.from_json` as fn-ref
4. **H4** — HTTP client + `HttpResponse`; Medium, adds `ureq`; test against httpbin.org or mock
5. **H5** — nested/array/enum `from_json` + integration tests; Med–High, depends on H3 + H4

**For 0.9.0 (after 0.8.4 is tagged):**
1. **L1** — error recovery; standalone UX improvement, no dependencies; also unblocks P2.4
2. **A2** — logger remaining work; independent, small-medium; can land any time
3. **P2** — REPL; high effort; land after L1 (needed for P2.4 error recovery)

**For 1.0.0 (after 0.9.0 is tagged):**
7. **R1** — workspace split; small change, unblocks all Tier W
8. **W1** — WASM foundation; highest risk in the IDE track; do first
9. **W2** + **W4** — editor shell + multi-file projects; can develop in parallel after W1
10. **W3** + **W5** — symbol navigation + docs browser; can follow independently
11. **W6** — export/import + PWA; closes the loop

---

## L — Language Quality

### L1  Error recovery after token failures
**Sources:** [DEVELOPERS.md](../DEVELOPERS.md) § "Diagnostic message quality" Step 5
**Severity:** Medium — a single missing `)` or `}` produces a flood of cascading errors
**Description:** Add `Lexer::recover_to(tokens: &[&str])` that skips tokens until one
of the given delimiters is found.  Call it after `token()` failures in contexts where
cascading is likely: missing `)` skips to `)` or `{`; missing `}` skips to `}` at same
brace depth; missing `=>` in match skips to `=>` or `,`.
**Fix path:**
1. Add `recover_to()` to `lexer.rs` — linear scan forward, stop at matching token or EOF.
2. Modify `token()` to call `recover_to` with context-appropriate delimiters.
3. Add tests that verify a single-error input produces at most 2 diagnostics.
**Effort:** Medium (lexer.rs + parser call sites; needs per-construct recovery targets)
**Target:** 0.9.0

---

---

---

---

### L6  Prevent double evaluation of `expr ?? default` *(completed 0.8.3)*

Implemented: non-trivial LHS expressions are materialised into a temp variable
before building the null-check conditional.  Tests in `25-null-coalescing.loft`.

---

### L7  `init(expr)` stored field initialiser with `$` reference
**Sources:** Design conversation 2026-03-25
**Severity:** Low–Medium — stored fields with derived defaults currently require the caller to
compute them manually at every construction site; `computed(expr)` covers the read-only case
but leaves no option for a mutable field with a smart default
**Description:** A new field modifier `init(expr)` evaluated once when a record is created
(like `= expr`) but allowed to reference `$` (the record being constructed) and therefore
other fields including `computed` ones.  After construction the field is writable like any
ordinary stored field.

```loft
struct Metrics {
    c: integer,                    // stored, writable, no default
    b: integer computed($.c),      // no storage — inlines $.c at every read
    a: integer init($.b * 5),      // stored at creation, writable after
}

m = Metrics { c: 3 };
// m.a == 15  (init evaluated: $.b → $.c → 3 * 5)
// m.b == 3   (computed: always $.c)
m.c = 10;
// m.b == 10  (computed: follows c)
// m.a == 15  (stored: frozen at init)
m.a = 99;    // ok: init fields are freely writable
```

**Modifier comparison:**

| Modifier | Storage | Writable | Evaluated | `$` allowed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(plain)* | yes | yes | never | no |
| `= literal` | yes | yes | once at init | no |
| `init(expr)` | yes | yes | once at init | **yes** |
| `computed(expr)` | no | no | on every read | yes |

`= expr` without `$` keeps its current meaning.  If `= expr` references `$`, it is a parse
error — users must use `init(expr)` explicitly so the init-time evaluation is visible.

**Evaluation order (struct):** `init(expr)` runs after all explicitly-supplied field values
have been written, so a `computed` field accessed inside `init` sees the supplied values of
the fields it depends on.

**Circular-init detection:** Two `init` fields that reference each other are a compile-time
error.  Build a dependency graph over `init` fields (extract all `$`-accesses from each init
expression), then DFS for cycles.  Runs during the first parser pass.

---

**Function parameter form:**

`init(expr)` is also allowed on function parameters to provide a dynamic default evaluated
at call time from earlier parameters:

```loft
fn normalize(x: float, y: float, scale: float init(sqrt(x*x + y*y))) -> Point {
    Point { x: x / scale, y: y / scale }
}

normalize(3.0, 4.0)              // scale = 5.0 (computed from x, y)
normalize(3.0, 4.0, scale: 1.0) // scale = 1.0 (explicit)
```

The `init` expression is evaluated at the call site when the argument is not supplied; earlier
parameters are already live stack slots and can be referenced directly (no `$` needed).
`init` parameters must appear after all parameters they reference, and — like `= expr`
defaults — after all required parameters.  Referencing a later parameter in `init(expr)` is
a compile-time error.

Existing `= expr` on parameters stays constant-only; if the expression references a parameter
name, the parser emits an error and suggests `init(expr)`.

---

**Fix path:**
1. **Lexer** (`src/lexer.rs`): add `"init"` to `KEYWORDS`.
2. **Parser — field modifier** (`src/parser/definitions.rs`, `parse_field_default`):
   extend the `computed/virtual` branch to also accept `"init"`; parse the expression the
   same way (`(` expr `)`); do **not** set `attribute.constant = true`.  Set a new
   `attribute.init = true` flag instead.
3. **Data model** (`src/data.rs`): add `pub init: bool` to `Attribute`; default `false`.
4. **Struct construction** (`src/parser/objects.rs`, field-init loop):
   for `init` fields, call `replace_record_ref(attr.value, record_ref)` at the call site —
   already done for stored defaults via `default = Self::replace_record_ref(default, code)`.
   Computed fields accessed inside the expression are transparently inlined by the existing
   `get_field` path (it already expands `constant` fields inline).
5. **Write guard**: the existing guard that errors on assignment to a `computed` field must
   not fire for `init` fields (`init == true`, `constant == false`); no change needed as
   `constant` stays `false`.
6. **Circular-init detection** (`src/parser/definitions.rs`, after parsing all struct
   fields): collect fields where `attribute.init`, extract `$`-access names via a recursive
   walk, build a directed graph, DFS for cycles; emit `diagnostic!(Level::Error, …)`.
7. **Parser — function parameter default** (`src/parser/definitions.rs`, parameter-parsing
   loop): extend the `= expr` default branch to also accept `init(expr)`; parse the
   expression in the current parameter scope (earlier params are already registered as
   `Value::Var(n)`); store the init expression alongside the parameter default.  At the
   call site, emit the expression as the argument value when no argument is supplied —
   identical to `= expr` defaults except the expression is not required to be constant.
8. **Docs**: update the grammar in `LOFT.md` (`field_mod` and `param` productions), add
   `init` to both the field modifier table and the parameter modifier table, add worked
   examples for both contexts.
9. **Tests** (`tests/scripts/init_field.loft`, `tests/scripts/init_param.loft`):
   - struct: basic `init` from a plain field; from a `computed` field; overridden in literal; mutated after construction; circular → compile error
   - function: default computed from earlier param; explicit arg overrides; `init` referencing a later param → compile error

**Effort:** Small–Medium (data.rs + lexer.rs + definitions.rs + objects.rs + docs + tests;
no bytecode or fill.rs changes needed)
**Target:** 0.8.3

---

**Severity:** Low–Medium — a REPL dramatically reduces iteration time when exploring data
or testing small snippets
**Description:** Running `loft` with no arguments (or `loft --repl`) enters an
interactive session where each line or block is parsed, compiled, and executed immediately.
State accumulates across lines (variables and type definitions persist).
```
$ loft
> x = 42
> "{x * 2}"
84
> struct Point { x: float, y: float }
> p = Point { x: 1.0, y: 2.0 }
> p.x + p.y
3.0
```
**Fix path:**

**Phase 1 — Input completeness detection** (`src/repl.rs`, new):
A pure function `is_complete(input: &str) -> bool` that tracks brace/paren depth to decide
whether to prompt for more input.  No parsing or execution involved.
*Tests:* single-line expressions return `true`; `fn foo() {` returns `false`;
`fn foo() {\n}` returns `true`; unclosed string literal returns `false`.

**Phase 2 — Single-statement execution** (`src/repl.rs`, `src/main.rs`):
Read one complete input, parse and execute it in a persistent `State` and `Stores`; no
output yet.  New type definitions and variable bindings accumulate across iterations.
*Tests:* `x = 42` persists; a subsequent `x + 1` evaluates to `43` in the same session.

**Phase 3 — Value output**:
Non-void expression results are printed automatically after execution; void statements
(assignments, `for` loops) produce no output.
*Tests:* entering `42` prints `42`; `x = 1` prints nothing; `"hello"` prints `hello`.

**Phase 4 — Error recovery**:
A parse or runtime error prints diagnostics and the session continues; the `State` is
left at the last successful checkpoint.
*Tests:* entering `x =` (syntax error) prints one diagnostic and re-prompts;
`x = 1` then succeeds and `x` holds `1`.

**Effort:** High (main.rs, parser.rs, new repl.rs)
**Target:** 0.9.0

---

### P3  Vector aggregates — `sum`, `min_of`, `max_of`, `any`, `all`, `count_if`
**Sources:** Standard library audit 2026-03-15
**Severity:** Low–Medium — common operations currently require manual `reduce`/loop boilerplate;
the building blocks (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`) are already present
**Description:** Typed overloads for each primitive element type:
```loft
// Sum (integer overload shown; long/float/single analogous)
pub fn sum(v: vector<integer>) -> integer { reduce(v, 0, fn __add_int) }

// Range min/max (avoids shadowing scalar min/max by using longer names)
pub fn min_of(v: vector<integer>) -> integer { ... }
pub fn max_of(v: vector<integer>) -> integer { ... }

// Predicates — require compiler special-casing (like map/filter) because fn-ref
// types are not generic; each overload hardcodes the element type
pub fn any(v: vector<integer>, pred: fn(integer)->boolean) -> boolean { ... }
pub fn all(v: vector<integer>, pred: fn(integer)->boolean) -> boolean { ... }
pub fn count_if(v: vector<integer>, pred: fn(integer)->boolean) -> integer { ... }
```
`sum`/`min_of`/`max_of` are straightforward reduce wrappers; `any`/`all`/`count_if`
are short-circuit loops that need a named helper or compiler special-casing.
Note: naming these `min_of`/`max_of` (not `min`/`max`) avoids collision with the built-in `min`/`max` stdlib functions.
**Fix path:** Typed loft overloads using `reduce` for sum/min_of/max_of; compiler
special-case in `parse_call` for `any`/`all`/`count_if` (same level of effort as similar compiler special-cases).
**Effort:** Low for aggregates (pure loft); Medium for any/all/count_if (compiler)
**Target:** 0.8.3 — batch all variants after P1 lands

---

---

### P4  Bytecode cache (`.loftc`)
**Sources:** [BYTECODE_CACHE.md](BYTECODE_CACHE.md)
**Severity:** Medium — repeated runs of an unchanged script re-parse and re-compile every
time; for scripts with many `use`-imported libraries this is measurably slow
**Description:** On first run, write a `.loftc` cache file next to the script containing
the compiled bytecode, type schema, function-position table, and source mtimes.  On
subsequent runs, if all mtimes and the binary hash match, skip the entire parse/compile
pipeline and execute directly from cache.
```
script.loft   →   script.loftc    (next to source; --cache-dir for override)
```
Phases:
- **C1** — single-file cache (4 files changed, no new dependencies)
- **C2** — library file invalidation (`Parser.imported_sources`)
- **C3** — debug info preserved (error messages still show file:line after cache hit)
- **C4** — `--cache-dir xdg` and `--no-cache` / `--invalidate-cache` flags
**Fix path:** See [BYTECODE_CACHE.md](BYTECODE_CACHE.md) for full detail.
**Effort:** Medium (C1 is Small; full C1–C4 is Medium)
**Target:** Deferred — superseded by Tier N (native Rust code generation eliminates
the recompile overhead that caching was designed to address)

### P5  First-parameter generic functions
**Sources:** Design conversation 2026-03-25
**Severity:** Medium — container helpers, identity-like functions, and pass-through
wrappers must be written once per concrete element type today; any new numeric type
(e.g. `u16`) immediately requires duplicating every such helper
**Description:** A single type variable `<T>` bound to the first parameter lets the
programmer write a function body once and have the compiler instantiate it for each
concrete type it is called with.

```loft
fn identity<T>(x: T) -> T { x }
fn first<T>(v: vector<T>) -> T { v[0] }
fn wrap<T>(x: T) -> vector<T> { [x] }
fn pair<T>(a: T, b: T) -> vector<T> { [a, b] }
fn print_and_return<T>(x: T, label: text) -> T { println(label); x }
```

`T` may appear in the first parameter position, any additional parameter of the same
type, and the return type.  It may also appear as the element type of a container
(`vector<T>`, `hash<T[key]>`, etc.) in any parameter or return position.

#### Allowed operations on T
Only operations that are defined on the container, not on T itself, are permitted:

| Allowed | Reason |
|---|---|
| Pass T through — assign, return, store in `vector<T>` | No type-specific code |
| `v[i]` where `v: vector<T>` | Indexing dispatches on the container, not on T |
| `v += [x]` where `v: vector<T>`, `x: T` | Append dispatches on the container |
| `len(v)` where `v: vector<T>` | Structural operation on the container |
| Concrete-typed parameters alongside T | No constraint on non-T params |

#### Disallowed operations — compile-time errors

| Situation | Error message |
|---|---|
| `x.field` where `x: T` | `generic type T: field access requires a concrete type — write a typed overload for each type that needs '{field}'` |
| `x + y`, `x - y`, etc. where x or y is T | `generic type T: operator '{op}' requires a concrete type — operators are type-specific` |
| `x.method()` where `x: T` | `generic type T: method call requires a concrete type — write a typed overload for each type that needs '{method}'` |
| `T { field: val }` construction | `generic type T: struct construction requires a concrete type` |
| `match x { ... }` where `x: T` | `generic type T: match requires a concrete type` |
| `x as SomeType` cast where `x: T` | `generic type T: explicit cast requires a concrete type` |
| Second type variable `<T, U>` | `only one type variable is supported; replace 'U' with a concrete type or write separate overloads` |
| T only in non-first position | `type variable T must appear as the first parameter — move T to the first parameter position` |
| Recursive generic call | `generic functions cannot call themselves recursively — instantiation is demand-driven` |
| T used in first-pass before any call | *(not an error — templates are not compiled until first use)* |

#### Implementation mechanics

Instantiation reuses the existing `t_<LEN><Type>_name` naming scheme, so no changes
to `find_fn`, bytecode compilation, or the runtime are required for instantiated
functions.  A generic `fn identity<T>` called with `x: Point` produces a concrete
definition stored as `t_5Point_identity`, indistinguishable from a hand-written
`fn identity(self: Point) -> Point { self }`.

The call-site lookup sequence in `parse_call` becomes:
1. Look for an exact typed match as today (`t_<LEN><Type>_name` or `n_name`).
2. If not found, look for `DefType::Generic` under `n_name`.
3. If found and arg[0]'s type is concrete: clone the template IR, substitute
   `Type::Unknown("T")` → concrete type, register the instantiated definition, emit
   the call.
4. If arg[0]'s type is still unknown at the call site: emit
   `cannot infer type for generic parameter T — provide an explicit type annotation`.

**Fix path:**

**P5.1 — Parser: `<T>` syntax + template registration** (`src/parser/definitions.rs`, `src/data.rs`):
After the `fn` keyword, detect `'<' Identifier '>'` and store the type-variable name.
Validate that the first parameter's declared type matches the type-variable name;
emit an error if `T` does not appear there.  Register the definition with a new
`DefType::Generic` variant instead of `DefType::Function`.  Parse the body in the
second pass as normal (this produces the template `Value` IR); skip the
`byte_code` compilation step for generic definitions — they are compiled only at
instantiation time.

**P5.2 — Call-site instantiation** (`src/parser/control.rs`):
In the not-found branch of `parse_call`, check whether a `DefType::Generic` exists
with the same name.  If yes, resolve arg[0]'s type; if it is concrete, call a new
`instantiate_generic(data, generic_def_nr, concrete_type)` function that:
1. Clones the template's `Value` IR and attribute list.
2. Replaces every `Type::Unknown("T")` with the concrete type.
3. Adds a new `DefType::Function` definition under the mangled name.
4. Calls `byte_code` on the new definition immediately so it is ready for execution.
Returns the new definition's `d_nr` and proceeds with the call as normal.

**P5.3 — Validation errors** (`src/parser/` — second pass of template body):
While parsing the template body, represent T as `Type::Unknown(GENERIC_T_SENTINEL)`
where `GENERIC_T_SENTINEL = u32::MAX - 1` — a value not used by any other
`Type::Unknown` producer (forward references use 1..u32::MAX-2; the parallel-worker
placeholder uses u32::MAX).  This avoids any change to the `Type` enum and leaves
all existing exhaustive match arms unchanged.

Guard `typedef.rs`'s forward-resolution loop so that it skips the sentinel value
(~3 lines).  Then at each error emission site, add a sentinel check before the
existing diagnostic:

| Error site | File | Change |
|---|---|---|
| Field access on unknown | `fields.rs:13` | `if tp == SENTINEL` → specific field error |
| Operator no match | `mod.rs` `call_op` | `if types[i] == SENTINEL` → specific operator error |
| Unary operator | `operators.rs:185` | Thread `Type` to the error site; add sentinel check |
| Method/function not found | `mod.rs:629` | Check arg[0] type before lookup failure error |
| match / cast on unknown | `control.rs` | Add sentinel check at each arm |

Total change: ~36 lines across 4–5 existing files; no enum changes; no impact on
compiled code that does not use generics.

**P5.4 — Tests + docs** (`tests/docs/`, `doc/claude/LOFT.md`):
- `tests/docs/35-generics.loft`: identity, first, wrap, pair, cross-type calls, each
  of the disallowed operations (each must produce the specified error message).
- Add a § "Generic functions" section to `LOFT.md` after the Polymorphism section.

**Effort:** Medium (definitions.rs, data.rs, control.rs, ~120–180 lines net new;
no changes to fill.rs, scopes.rs, or the runtime)
**Target:** 0.8.3

### T1  Tuple types
**Sources:** TUPLES.md
**Description:** Multi-value returns and stack-allocated `(A, B, C)` compound values. Enables functions to return more than one value without heap allocation. Seven implementation phases; full design in [TUPLES.md](TUPLES.md).

- **T1.1** — Type system: `Type::Tuple`, element offsets, `element_size` helpers (`src/data.rs`, `src/typedef.rs`).
- **T1.2** — Parser: type notation `(A, B)`, literal syntax, destructuring assignment (`src/parser/`).
- **T1.3** — Scope analysis: tuple variable intervals, text/ref element lifetimes (`src/scopes.rs`).
- **T1.4** — Bytecode codegen: slot allocation, element read/write opcodes (`src/state/codegen.rs`).
- **T1.5** — SC-4: Reference-tuple parameters with owned elements.
- **T1.6** — SC-8: Tuple-aware mutation guard.
- **T1.7** — SC-7: `not null` annotation for tuple integer elements.

**Effort:** Very High
**Target:** 1.1+

### CO1  Coroutines
**Sources:** COROUTINE.md
**Description:** Stackful `yield`, `iterator<T>` return type, and `yield from` delegation. Enables lazy sequences and producer/consumer patterns without explicit state machines. Six implementation phases; full design in [COROUTINE.md](COROUTINE.md).

- **CO1.1** — `iterator<T>` type + `CoroutineStatus` enum in `default/05_coroutine.loft`.
- **CO1.2** — `OpCoroutineCreate` + `OpCoroutineNext`: frame construction and advance.
- **CO1.3** — `OpYield`: serialise live stack to heap frame, return to caller.
- **CO1.4** — `yield from`: sub-generator delegation.
- **CO1.5** — `for item in generator`: iterator protocol integration.
- **CO1.6** — `next()` / `exhausted()` stdlib functions.

**Effort:** Very High
**Depends:** TR1
**Target:** 1.1+

## A — Architecture

### A1  Parallel workers: struct/reference return types *(completed 0.8.3)*

All parallel worker return types are now supported: primitives, text, enum, and
struct/reference.  Struct returns use deep-copy (`copy_block` + `copy_claims`) in
the bytecode interpreter and `n_parallel_for_ref_native` in native codegen.
The native skip for `40-par-ref-return` has been removed.

---

### A2  Logger: hot-reload, run-mode helpers, release + debug flags
**Sources:** [LOGGER.md](LOGGER.md) § Remaining Work
**Description:** Four independent improvements to the logging system.  The core framework
(production mode, source-location injection, log file rotation, rate limiting) was shipped
in 0.8.0.  These are the remaining pieces.
**Fix path:**

**A2.1 — Wire hot-reload** (`src/native.rs`):
Call `lg.check_reload()` at the top of each `n_log_*`, `n_panic`, and `n_assert` body so
the config file is re-read at most every 5 s.  `check_reload()` is already implemented.
*Tests:* write a config file; change the level mid-run; verify subsequent calls respect the new level.

**A2.2 — `is_production()` and `is_debug()` helpers** (`src/native.rs`, `default/01_code.loft`):
Two new loft natives read `stores.run_mode`.  The `RunMode` enum replaces the current
`production: bool` flag on `RuntimeLogConfig` so all runtime checks share one source of truth.
*Tests:* a loft program calling `is_production()` returns `true` under `--production`/`--release`
and `false` otherwise; `is_debug()` returns `true` only under `--debug`.

**A2.3 — `--release` flag with zero-overhead assert elision** (`src/parser/control.rs`, `src/main.rs`):
`--release` implies `--production` AND strips `assert()` and `debug_assert()` from bytecode
at parse time (replaced by `Value::Null`).  Adds `debug_assert(test, message)` as a
companion to `assert()` that is also elided in release mode.
*Tests:* a `--release` run skips assert; `--release` + failed assert does not log or panic.

**A2.4 — `--debug` flag with per-type runtime safety logging** (`src/fill.rs`, `src/native.rs`):
When `stores.run_mode == Debug`, emit `warn` log entries for silent-null conditions:
integer/long overflow, shift out-of-range, null field dereference, vector OOB.
*Tests:* a deliberate overflow under `--debug` produces a `WARN` entry at the correct file:line.

**Effort:** Medium (logger.rs, native.rs, fill.rs; see LOGGER.md for full design)
**Target:** 0.9.0

### A4  Spatial index operations (full implementation)
**Sources:** PROBLEMS #22
**Description:** `spacial<T>` collection type: insert, lookup, and iteration operations
are not implemented.  The pre-gate (compile error) was added 2026-03-15.
**Fix path:**

**Phase 1 — Insert and exact lookup** (`src/database/`, `src/fill.rs`):
Implement `spacial.insert(elem)` and `spacial[key]` for point queries.  Remove the
compile-error pre-gate for these two operations only; all other `spacial` ops remain gated.
*Tests:* insert 3 points, retrieve each by exact key; null returned for missing key.

**Phase 2 — Bounding-box range query** (`src/database/`, `src/parser/collections.rs`):
Implement `for e in spacial[x1..x2, y1..y2]` returning all elements within a bounding box.
*Tests:* 10 points; query a sub-region; verify count and identity of results.

**Phase 3 — Removal** (`src/database/`):
Implement `spacial[key] = null` and `remove` inside an active iterator.
*Tests:* insert 5, remove 2, verify 3 remain and removed points are never returned.

**Phase 4 — Full iteration** (`src/database/`, `src/state/io.rs`):
Implement `for e in spacial` visiting all elements; compatible with the existing iterator
protocol (sorted/index/vector).  Remove the remaining pre-gate.
*Tests:* insert N points, iterate all, count matches N; reverse iteration produces correct order.

**Effort:** High (new index type in database.rs and vector.rs)
**Target:** 1.1+

---

### A5  Closure capture for lambda expressions
**Sources:** Depends on P1
**Description:** P1 defines anonymous functions without variable capture.  Full closures
require the compiler to identify captured variables, allocate a closure record, and pass
it as a hidden argument to the lambda body.  This is a significant IR and bytecode change.
**Fix path:**

**Phase 1 — Capture analysis** (`src/scopes.rs`, `src/parser/expressions.rs`):
Walk the lambda body's IR and identify all free variables (variables referenced inside
the body that are defined in an enclosing scope).  No code generation yet.
*Tests:* static analysis correctly identifies free variables in sample lambdas; variables
defined inside the lambda are not flagged; non-capturing lambdas produce an empty set.

**Phase 2 — Closure record layout** (`src/data.rs`, `src/typedef.rs`):
For each capturing lambda, synthesise an anonymous struct type whose fields hold the
captured variables; verify field offsets and total size.
The element-size table and offset arithmetic introduced for tuples (see
[TUPLES.md](TUPLES.md) § Memory Layout) are identical for closure record fields; use
the shared helpers `element_size`, `element_offsets`, and `owned_elements` from
`data.rs` rather than duplicating the logic.  The closure record is heap-allocated
(a store record) and passed as a hidden trailing argument alongside the def-nr — it
does not use the stack-only tuple layout.
*Tests:* closure struct has the correct field count, types, and sizes; `sizeof` matches
the expected layout; a record containing a `text` capture has `owned_elements` count 1.

**Phase 3 — Capture at call site** (`src/state/codegen.rs`):
At the point where a lambda expression is evaluated, emit code to allocate a closure
record and copy the current values of the captured variables into it.  Pass the record
as a hidden trailing argument alongside the def-nr.  Copying a captured `text`
variable into the record requires a deep copy (same rule as tuple text elements —
see [TUPLES.md](TUPLES.md) § Copy Semantics).
*Tests:* captured variable has the correct value when the lambda is called immediately
after its definition; captured `text` is independent of the original after capture.

**Phase 4 — Closure body reads** (`src/state/codegen.rs`, `src/fill.rs`):
Inside the compiled lambda function, redirect reads of captured variables to load from
the closure record argument rather than the (non-existent) enclosing stack frame.
*Tests:* captured variable is correctly read after the enclosing function has returned;
modifying the original variable after capture does not affect the lambda's copy (value
semantics — mutable capture is out of scope for this item).

**Phase 5 — Lifetime and cleanup** (`src/scopes.rs`):
Emit `OpFreeRef` for the closure record at the end of the enclosing scope.  When the
record contains `text` or `reference` captures, free them in **reverse field index
order** before releasing the record itself — the same LIFO invariant required by tuple
scope exit (see [TUPLES.md](TUPLES.md) § Calling Convention, Scope exit order).  Use
`owned_elements` from Phase 2 to enumerate the fields that need freeing.
*Tests:* no store leak after a lambda goes out of scope; LIFO free order is respected
when multiple closures are live simultaneously; a `text` capture is freed exactly once.

**Effort:** Very High (parser.rs, state.rs, scopes.rs, store.rs)
**Depends on:** P1 (done)
**Target:** 0.8.3

---

### A7  Native extension libraries
**Sources:** [EXTERNAL_LIBS.md](EXTERNAL_LIBS.md) Phase 2
**Severity:** Low — core language and stdlib cover most use cases; native extensions target
specialised domains (graphics, audio, database drivers) that cannot be expressed in loft
**Description:** Allow separately-packaged libraries to ship a compiled Rust `cdylib`
alongside their `.loft` API files.  The shared library exports `loft_register_v1()` and
registers native functions via `state.static_fn()`.  A new `#native "name"` annotation in
`.loft` API files references an externally-registered symbol (parallel to the existing
`#rust "..."` inline-code annotation).

Example package: an `opengl` library with `src/opengl.loft` declaring `pub fn gl_clear(c: integer);` `#native "n_gl_clear"` and `native/libloft_opengl.so` containing the Rust implementation.
**Fix path:**
- **Phase 1 — `#native` annotation + symbol registration** (parser, compiler, `state.rs`):
  Parse `#native "symbol_name"` on `pub fn` declarations in `.loft` API files.  In the
  compiler, emit a call to a new `OpCallNative(symbol_id)` opcode that dispatches via a
  `HashMap<String, NativeFn>` registered at startup.  Add `State::register_native()` for
  tests.  Test: register a hand-written Rust function, call it from loft, verify result.
- **Phase 2 — `cdylib` loader** (new optional feature `native-ext`, `libloading` dep):
  Add `State::load_plugin(path)` that `dlopen`s the shared library and calls
  `loft_register_v1(state)`.  Gated behind `--features native-ext` so the default binary
  stays free of `libloading`.  Test: build a minimal `cdylib` in the test suite, load it,
  verify it registers correctly.
- **Phase 3 — package layout + `plugin-api` crate** (new workspace member):
  Introduce `loft-plugin-api/` with the stable C ABI (`loft_register_v1`, `NativeFnCtx`).
  Document the package layout (`src/*.loft` + `native/lib*.so`).  Add an example package
  under `examples/opengl-stub/`.  Update EXTERNAL_LIBS.md to reflect the final API.

Full detail in [EXTERNAL_LIBS.md](EXTERNAL_LIBS.md) Phase 2.
**Effort:** High (parser, compiler, extensions loader, plugin API crate)
**Depends on:** —
**Target:** 0.9.0

### A10  Field iteration — `for f in s#fields`
**Sources:** Design evaluation 2026-03-18; syntax decision 2026-03-19
**Description:** Allow iterating over the stored primitive fields of a struct value with
`for f in s#fields`.  The loop variable `f` has type `Field` (defined in
`default/01_code.loft`) with `f.name: text` (the compile-time field name) and
`f.value: FieldValue` (a struct-enum covering all primitive types).  Native type capture
uses existing `match f.value { Float{v} => ... }` pattern syntax.

The loop is a compile-time unroll: the parser expands `for f in s#fields` into one
sequential block per eligible field.  No runtime allocation is needed.  Fields whose
type is a reference, collection, or nested struct are skipped in this version.

**Syntax choice — `s#fields` vs `fields(s)`:**
`s#fields` was chosen over `fields(s)` to avoid reserving `fields` as a keyword.
`fields` is a common English word (it was already used as an identifier in 3 stdlib files
and had to be renamed when L3 added it to KEYWORDS).  The `#` postfix pattern already
avoids keyword reservation for `count`, `first`, `index`, `remove`, etc., and the same
mechanism works here.  Constraint: the source `s` must be a plain identifier; for complex
expressions, assign a temporary first (`let cfg = get_config(); for f in cfg#fields`).

```loft
struct Config { host: text, port: integer not null, debug: boolean }
c = Config{ host: "localhost", port: 8080, debug: true };

for f in c#fields {
    match f.value {
        Text { v } => log_info("{f.name} = '{v}'")
        Int  { v } => log_info("{f.name} = {v}")
        Bool { v } => log_info("{f.name} = {v}")
        _          => {}
    }
}
```

**Fix path:**

**Phase A10.0 — Remove `fields` from `KEYWORDS`** (`src/lexer.rs`):
Delete `"fields"` from the `KEYWORDS` static array (reverting the L3 code change).
The identifier renames made during L3 (`type_fields`, `flds`, `items`) can remain as
they are improvements in their own right.
*Tests:* existing tests pass; `fields` is legal as a variable, function, and field name
in user code again.

**Phase A10.1 — `Field` and `FieldValue` types** (`default/01_code.loft`):
Define the two public types that form the loop variable contract.  No compiler changes in
this phase.

```loft
pub enum FieldValue {
    Bool   { v: boolean },
    Int    { v: integer },
    Long   { v: long },
    Float  { v: float },
    Single { v: single },
    Char   { v: character },
    Text   { v: text },
    Enum   { name: text not null, ordinal: integer not null },
}

pub struct Field {
    name:  text not null,
    value: FieldValue,
}
```

`Enum` carries both the variant name (for display) and the ordinal (for comparison).
Reference, collection, and nested-struct fields are excluded from `FieldValue`; the
compiler will skip those field types silently in Phase A10.3.
*Tests:* `Field` and `FieldValue` are usable in normal loft code; a hand-constructed
`Field{name: "x", value: FieldValue::Float{v: 1.0}}` round-trips through a match arm.

**Phase A10.2 — `ident#fields` detection in `parse_for`** (`src/parser/collections.rs`,
`src/data.rs`):
In `parse_for`, after reading the source identifier, check `lexer.has_token("#")` followed
by `lexer.has_keyword("fields")`.  If matched, resolve the identifier's type; validate it
is a struct (non-struct → clear compile error: `#fields requires a struct variable, got
<type>`).  Return a new IR node `Value::FieldsOf(struct_def_nr, Box<source_expr>)` with
type `Type::FieldsOf(struct_def_nr)`.

```
// data.rs — add to Value enum
FieldsOf(u32, Box<Value>),   // (struct def_nr, source expression)

// data.rs — add to Type enum
FieldsOf(u32),               // struct def_nr; erased after loop unrolling
```

*Tests:* `for f in point#fields` on a known struct type-checks without error; `for f in
n#fields` where `n: integer` produces one diagnostic naming the offending type.

**Phase A10.3 — Loop unrolling** (`src/parser/collections.rs`):
In `parse_for` (or the `parse_in_range` helper that determines iterator type), detect
`Type::FieldsOf(struct_def_nr)` and take the unrolling path instead of the normal
`v_loop` path.

Algorithm:
1. Declare loop variable `f` with type `Field` in the current variable scope.
2. Parse the loop body once (first pass: types still unknown; second pass: body typed
   against `Field`).
3. For each field in `data.structs[struct_def_nr].fields` in declaration order:
   a. Determine the `FieldValue` variant for the field's type:
      - `boolean` → `Bool`, `integer` (all limit variants) → `Int`, `long` → `Long`,
        `float` → `Float`, `single` → `Single`, `character` → `Char`,
        `text` → `Text`, plain enum → `Enum`
      - reference / collection / nested struct → **skip this field**
   b. Build the Field constructor IR:
      ```
      Value::Call(field_ctor_nr, [
          Value::Str(field_name),                         // f.name
          Value::Call(fv_variant_ctor_nr, [               // f.value
              <source_expr>.field_name,                   // actual field read
          ]),
      ])
      ```
      For plain enum fields the variant is `Enum{ name: format_enum(s.variant), ordinal: s.variant as integer }`.
   c. Emit `v_block([v_set(f_var, field_constructor), body_copy])`.
4. Wrap all N blocks in a single `v_block`.  The result replaces the normal loop IR.

`break` and `continue` inside a `for f in s#fields` body are a compile error in this
version (emit: `break/continue not supported in field loops`).

*Tests:*
- Iterate over `struct Point { x: float not null, y: float not null, z: float not null }`:
  verify three iterations; `f.name` values are `"x"`, `"y"`, `"z"`; `f.value` matches
  `Float{v}` with the correct values.
- Iterate over a mixed-type struct (`integer`, `text`, `boolean`, `float` fields): all four
  `FieldValue` variants are matched correctly in the same loop body.
- Null field value: a nullable text field holding `null` produces `Text{v: null}`; the match
  arm `Text{v}` binds `v = null`.
- Plain enum field: produces `Enum{name: "Red", ordinal: 0}` for a `Color::Red` value.
- Struct with a reference field and a vector field: those fields are skipped; only the
  primitive fields are visited.
- `break` inside the body: compile error with message naming the field loop restriction.
- Non-struct `n#fields` where `n: integer`: single diagnostic, no crash.

**Phase A10.4 — Error messages and documentation** (`doc/claude/LOFT.md`,
`doc/claude/STDLIB.md`):
Polish pass: verify error messages are clear and point to the right source location.
Add `s#fields` to LOFT.md § Control flow (alongside `for`) and to STDLIB.md § Structs.
Document the skipped-field limitation, the identifier-only constraint, and the future
`A10+` path for non-primitive fields.
*Tests:* `ref_val#fields` (reference type, not the struct it points to) gives a clear
error distinguishing "you have a reference; use a struct variable, not a reference" from
the generic type-mismatch message.

**Limitations (initial version):**
- Only primitive-typed fields are visited; reference, collection, and nested-struct fields
  are silently skipped.
- `break` and `continue` are not supported inside the loop body.
- The source must be a plain identifier, not an arbitrary expression.  Use a temporary:
  `let cfg = get_config(); for f in cfg#fields { ... }`.
- `s#fields` is only valid as the source expression of a `for` loop, not as a standalone
  expression producing a `vector<Field>`.
- `virtual` fields are included (they are read-only computed values, still primitive).

**Effort:** Medium (data.rs + 2 parser files + default library; no bytecode changes)
**Target:** 0.8.3

### S14  Struct-enum stdlib field positions *(completed 0.8.3)*

Fixed: `fill_all()` now processes all definitions from 0 (not `start_def`), and the
discriminant field uses `database.byte(0, false)` instead of `database.name("byte")`.

---

### S15  Struct-enum same-name variant field offsets (PROBLEMS #81)
**Sources:** Discovered during A10 development; [CAVEATS.md](CAVEATS.md) C10
**Severity:** Medium — blocks A10 mixed-type field iteration; affects any struct-enum
where multiple variants use the same field name with different types
**Description:** When `enum Fv { FvInt { v: integer }, FvFloat { v: float } }` is
constructed as `FvInt { v: 42 }` and matched with `FvInt { v } => v`, the value
reads from the wrong byte offset — returning garbage that looks like float bytes
reinterpreted as integer.

**Root cause:** Each variant gets its own `known_type` via
`database.structure()` in `src/typedef.rs:210`.  Field offsets are assigned by
`database.field()` at line 295.  The offset depends on the preceding fields in
the variant's record, starting after the enum discriminant byte.

When `get_field(variant_def_nr, attr_idx, ...)` is called during match binding
(`src/parser/control.rs:630`), it calls `database.position(known_type, name)`.
If `known_type` is correct per-variant, the offset should be correct.

**Diagnosis needed:** dump `known_type` for each variant and compare the field
offsets.  The issue may be that the discriminant field ("enum") occupies
different sizes across variants, or that field alignment differs.
Use `LOFT_LOG=static` and inspect the type table for each variant.

**Fix path:**
1. Add diagnostic logging in `fill_database()` to print each variant's
   `known_type`, field name, and assigned position.
2. Compare the positions for `FvInt.v` vs `FvFloat.v` — they should differ
   because `integer` is 4 bytes and `float` is 8 bytes, but the discriminant
   + padding before `v` must be consistent.
3. Fix the offset calculation if variants with different-sized fields get
   misaligned positions.
*Tests:* construct each variant, match, read the field, verify value.

**Effort:** Medium (requires understanding database field layout)
**Target:** 0.8.3

### L8  Warn on format specifier / type mismatch *(completed 0.8.3)*

Implemented: compile-time warnings in `append_data()` for numeric format specifiers
on text/boolean and zero-padding on text.  Tests in `38-parse-warnings.loft`.

### A12  Lazy work-variable initialization
**Status: deferred to 1.1+ — too complex and disruptive for stability; also blocked by Issues 68–70 (see PROBLEMS.md)**
**Sources:** Stack efficiency evaluation 2026-03-20
**Description:** Work text variables (`__work_N`) are currently initialized at function
start via `Set(wt, Text(""))` inserted at index 0 of the body block.  This forces
`first_def = 0` for every work text variable, making its live interval span the entire
function.  Two sequential, non-overlapping text operations each hold a 24-byte slot for
the full lifetime of the call frame.  The same applies to non-inline work ref variables
(`__ref_N`), which also get function-start null-inits.

Inline-ref temporaries already use lazy insertion (per A6.3a work): their null-init is
placed immediately before the statement that first assigns them, giving accurate intervals.
This item extends that approach to all work variables.

**Fix path:**

*Step 1 — Rename and generalize `inline_ref_set_in`* (`src/parser/expressions.rs`):

Rename `inline_ref_set_in` to `first_set_in` (or add it as a general helper).  No logic
changes — the function already recurses into all relevant `Value` variants and works
correctly for both text and ref work variables.

*Step 2 — Extend insertion loop in `parse_code` to work texts*:

Replace the eager-insert loop for work texts with a lazy-insert using `first_set_in`.
Non-inline work references remain eagerly inserted at position 0 (see blocker below).
Inline-ref variables continue to use the same lazy path as before.

```rust
// BEFORE: for wt in work_texts() { ls.insert(0, v_set(wt, Text(""))) }
// AFTER: find the first top-level statement containing a Set to wt, insert before it.
let mut insertions: Vec<(usize, u16, Value)> = Vec::new();
for wt in self.vars.work_texts() {
    let pos = ls.iter().position(|stmt| first_set_in(stmt, wt, 0)).unwrap_or(fallback);
    insertions.push((pos, wt, Value::Text(String::new())));
}
// work_references: still position 0 (blocker: Issue 68)
for r in self.vars.work_references() {
    if !is_argument && depend.is_empty() && !is_inline_ref {
        insertions.push((0, r, Value::Null));
    }
}
for r in self.vars.inline_ref_references() { ... lazy as before ... }
insertions.sort_by(|a, b| b.0.cmp(&a.0).then(b.1.cmp(&a.1)));
for (pos, r, init) in insertions { ls.insert(pos, v_set(r, init)); }
```

**Known blockers (found during 2026-03-20 implementation):**

- **Issue 68** — `first_set_in` does not descend into `Block`/`Loop` nodes.  Work
  references used only inside a nested block cannot be found; the fallback position lands
  *after* the block, giving `first_def > last_use`.  Fix: add `Block` and `Loop` arms to
  `first_set_in`.  Until then, non-inline work references stay at position 0.

- **Issue 69** — Extending `can_reuse` in `assign_slots` to `Type::Text` causes slot
  conflicts: two smaller variables can independently claim the first bytes of the same
  dead 24-byte text slot.  The `assign_slots_sequential_text_reuse` unit test passes in
  isolation (with explicit non-overlapping intervals) but the integration suite fails.
  Full text slot sharing also requires OpFreeText to be placed after each variable's last
  use (not at function end), otherwise sequential work texts still have overlapping live
  intervals.  Both issues must be resolved before `can_reuse` is extended.

- **Issue 70** — Adding `Type::Text` to the `pos < TOS` bump-to-TOS override in
  `generate_set` causes SIGSEGV in `append_fn`.  This override was added to handle
  "uninitialized memory if lazy init places a text var below current TOS", but that
  scenario only arises when text slots are reused (Issue 69), which is disabled.  The
  override must be reverted until text slot reuse is safe.

*Interval effect (partial):* `first_def` for work texts is now accurate.  Slot sharing
requires resolving Issues 69 and 70 and moving OpFreeText to after each variable's last
use.

**Tests:** `assign_slots_sequential_text_reuse` in `src/variables/` (currently
`#[ignore]` — pending Issue 69 fix).
**Effort:** Medium (three inter-related blockers; Issues 68–70)
**Target:** 0.8.2

### A13  Complete two-zone slot assignment (Steps 8 and 10) *(completed 0.8.3)*

All steps done.  Step 8 was completed earlier.  Step 10:
- **10a** — Full cross-check (2026-03-24) confirmed `build_scope_parents`, `scan_inner`,
  and `compute_intervals` all handle every `Value` variant with nested expressions.
- **10b** — `Value::Iter` arm already present in `scan_inner` (added earlier).
- **Scope-cycle root cause** — Fixed: `build_scope_parents` now uses `entry().or_insert()`
  to keep the first-seen parent and skips self-loops (`bl.scope == parent`).

### TR1  Stack trace introspection
**Sources:** STACKTRACE.md
**Description:** `stack_trace()` stdlib function returning `vector<StackFrame>`, where each frame exposes function name, source file, and line number. Full design in [STACKTRACE.md](STACKTRACE.md). Prerequisite for CO1 (coroutines use the frame vector for yield/resume).

- **TR1.1** — Shadow call-frame vector: push/pop a `(fn_name, line)` entry on each function call/return in `src/state/mod.rs`.
- **TR1.2** — Type declarations: `ArgValue` enum and `StackFrame` struct in `default/04_stacktrace.loft`.
- **TR1.3** — Materialisation: `stack_trace()` native function builds `vector<StackFrame>` from the shadow vector.
- **TR1.4** — Call-site line numbers: track source position in the call frame for accurate per-frame line reporting.

**Effort:** Medium
**Target:** 0.9.0

## S — Stability Hardening

Items found in a systematic stability audit (2026-03-20).  Each addresses a panic,
silent failure, or missing bound in the interpreter and database engine.  All target 0.8.2.

---

### S6  Fix remaining "recursive call sees stale attribute count" cases
**Sources:** PROBLEMS.md #84
**Severity:** Medium — the merge-sort use-after-free (the primary manifestation) was fixed in 0.8.2.  Complex mutual-recursion patterns that trigger `ref_return` on a function after its recursive call sites were already compiled may still produce wrong attribute counts.
**Description:** `ref_return` adds work-ref attributes to a function's IR while the body is still being parsed.  When the function is recursive, call sites parsed before `ref_return` runs see the old (smaller) attribute count.  The merge-sort case was fixed by guarding `vector_needs_db` with `!is_argument` and injecting the return-ref in `parse_return`.  A general fix would scan the IR tree after the second parse pass and patch under-argument recursive calls via `add_defaults`.
**Fix path:** Post-parse IR scan and call-site patching in `parse_function`.
**Effort:** Medium
**Target:** 1.1+

## N — Native Codegen

All N-tier items (N1–N9) are completed.  Native test parity achieved 2026-03-23:
all `.loft` tests pass in both interpreter and native mode.
Full design in [NATIVE.md](NATIVE.md).

---

### O1  Superinstruction merging
**Status: deferred to 1.1+ — too complex and disruptive for current release stability**
**Sources:** PERFORMANCE.md § P1
**Description:** Peephole pass in `src/compile.rs` merges common 4-opcode sequences (var/var/op/put) into single opcodes 240–245. Six new entries added to the `OPERATORS` array in `src/fill.rs`. Operands encoded in the same byte count as the replaced sequence, so branch targets need no relocation.
**Expected gain:** 2–4× on tight integer loops; benefits every loop in the interpreter.
**Effort:** Medium
**Target:** 1.1+

---

### O2  Stack raw pointer cache
**Sources:** PERFORMANCE.md § P2
**Description:** Add `stack_base: *mut u8` to `State`; refresh once per function call/return; eliminate the `database.store()` lookup on every push/pop. A `stack_dirty` flag, set by allocation ops, triggers a refresh at the top of the dispatch loop.
**Expected gain:** 20–50% across all interpreter benchmarks.
**Effort:** High
**Target:** 1.1+

---

**Target:** 0.8.2

---

### O4  Native: direct-emit local collections
**Sources:** PERFORMANCE.md § N1
**Description:** Escape analysis pass marks collection variables as `Local` when they never leave the function (not ref-passed, not stored in a struct field). For `Local` variables, emit `Vec<T>` / `HashMap` directly, bypassing `codegen_runtime` helpers and `DbRef` indirection entirely.
**Expected gain:** 5–15× on data-structure benchmarks (word frequency 16×, dot product 12×, insertion sort 7×).
**Effort:** High
**Target:** 1.1+

---

### O5  Native: omit `stores` param from pure functions
**Sources:** PERFORMANCE.md § N2
**Description:** Purity analysis identifies functions whose IR contains no store reads or writes, no IO, no format ops. These emit a `_pure` variant without the `stores: &mut Stores` parameter; the outer wrapper with `stores` delegates to `_pure`. Enables `rustc -O` to inline across recursive calls.
**Expected gain:** 10–30% on recursive compute benchmarks.
**Effort:** High
**Depends:** O4
**Target:** 1.1+

---

---

### O7  wasm: pre-allocate string buffers in format path
**Sources:** PERFORMANCE.md § W1
**Description:** Pre-allocate the result string with `String::with_capacity` before format-string loops in generated wasm code, and use `push_str` instead of `+` to avoid intermediate allocations through wasm's linear-memory allocator.
**Expected gain:** Reduces wasm/native string-building gap from 2× to <1.3×.
**Effort:** Medium
**Depends:** W1
**Target:** 1.1+

## H — HTTP / Web Services

Full design rationale and approach comparison: [WEB_SERVICES.md](WEB_SERVICES.md).

The `#json` annotation is the key enabler: it synthesises `to_json` and `from_json` for a
struct, making `Type.from_json` a first-class callable fn-ref that composes with `map` and
`filter`.  The HTTP client is a thin blocking wrapper (via `ureq`) returning a plain
`HttpResponse` struct — no thread-local state, parallel-safe.  All web functionality is
gated behind an `http` Cargo feature.

---

### H1  `#json` annotation — parser and `to_json` synthesis
**Sources:** [WEB_SERVICES.md](WEB_SERVICES.md) § Approach B, Phase 1
**Description:** Extend the annotation parser to accept `#json` (no value) before a struct
declaration.  For every annotated struct, the compiler synthesises a `to_json` method that
reuses the existing `:j` JSON format flag.  No new Rust dependencies are needed.
**Fix path:**

**Step 1 — Parser** (`src/parser/parser.rs` or `src/parser/expressions.rs`):
Extend the annotation-parsing path that currently handles `#rust "..."` to also accept
bare `#json`.  Store a `json: bool` flag on the struct definition node (parallel to how
`#rust` stores its string).  Emit a clear parse error if `#json` is placed on anything
other than a struct.
*Test:* `#json` before a struct compiles without error; `#json` before a `fn` produces a
single clear diagnostic.

**Step 2 — Synthesis** (`src/state/typedef.rs`):
During type registration, for each struct with `json: true`, synthesise an implicit `pub fn`
definition equivalent to:
```loft
pub fn to_json(self: T) -> text { "{self:j}" }
```
The synthesised def shares the struct's source location for error messages.
*Test:* `"{user:j}"` and `user.to_json()` produce identical output for a `#json` struct.

**Step 3 — Error for missing annotation** (`src/state/typedef.rs`):
If `to_json` is called on a struct without `#json`, emit a compile error:
`"to_json requires #json annotation on struct T"`.
*Test:* Unannotated struct calling `.to_json()` produces a single clear diagnostic.

**Effort:** Small (parser annotation extension + typedef synthesiser)
**Target:** 0.8.4
**Depends on:** —

### H2  JSON primitive extraction stdlib
**Sources:** [WEB_SERVICES.md](WEB_SERVICES.md) § Approach B; CODE.md § Dependencies
**Description:** Add a new stdlib module `default/04_web.loft` with JSON field-extraction
functions.  Functions extract a single typed value from a JSON object body supplied as
a `text` string.  No `serde_json` dependency — the existing parsing primitives in
`src/database/structures.rs` are sufficient; a new `src/database/json.rs` module adds
schema-free navigation on top.
**Fix path:**

**Step 1 — Cargo dependency** (`Cargo.toml`):
Add only `ureq` (used in H4) under a new `http` optional feature.  No `serde_json`.
```toml
[features]
http = ["ureq"]

[dependencies]
ureq = { version = "2", optional = true }
```

**Step 2 — `src/database/json.rs`** (new file, ~80 lines, no new dependency):
Add as a submodule of `src/database/`.  Provides three `pub(crate)` building blocks:

```rust
// Find `key` in a top-level JSON object; return raw value slice (unallocated).
pub(crate) fn json_get_raw<'a>(text: &'a str, key: &str) -> Option<&'a str>

// Return raw JSON text for each element of a top-level JSON array.
pub(crate) fn json_array_items(text: &str) -> Vec<String>

// Parse a raw value slice into a Rust primitive (loft null sentinels on failure):
pub(crate) fn as_text(raw: &str) -> String   // strips quotes + handles \n \t \\
pub(crate) fn as_int(raw: &str) -> i32       // i32::MIN on failure
pub(crate) fn as_long(raw: &str) -> i64      // i64::MIN on failure
pub(crate) fn as_float(raw: &str) -> f64     // f64::NAN on failure
pub(crate) fn as_bool(raw: &str) -> bool     // false on failure
```

Internally `json.rs` uses its own `skip_ws`, `skip_value`, and `extract_string` helpers
(~50 lines combined).  These mirror the primitives in `structures.rs` but operate
schema-free: no `Stores`, no `DbRef`, no type lookup.  The byte-scanning logic is
identical in style to the existing `match_text` / `skip_float` functions.

*Design note:* The primitives in `structures.rs` (`match_text`, `match_integer`, etc.)
are `fn` (module-private) because they are only called by `parsing()` within the same
module.  Rather than widening their visibility, `json.rs` keeps its own small copies
to preserve the clean boundary between schema-driven and schema-free parsing.

**Step 3 — Loft declarations** (`default/04_web.loft`):
```loft
// Extract primitive values from a JSON object body.
// Returns zero/empty/null-sentinel if the key is absent or type does not match.
pub fn json_text(body: text, key: text) -> text;
pub fn json_int(body: text, key: text) -> integer;
pub fn json_long(body: text, key: text) -> long;
pub fn json_float(body: text, key: text) -> float;
pub fn json_bool(body: text, key: text) -> boolean;

// Split a JSON array body into element bodies (each element as raw JSON text).
pub fn json_items(array_body: text) -> vector<text>;

// Extract a named field as raw JSON text (object, array, or primitive).
// Use for nested structs and array fields: json_nested(body, "field").
pub fn json_nested(body: text, key: text) -> text;
```

**Step 4 — Rust implementation** (new `src/native_http.rs`, registered in `src/native.rs`):
Each native function calls `json::json_get_raw` then the appropriate `as_*` converter.
All functions return the loft null sentinel (or empty string) on any error — never panic.
- `json_text`: `json_get_raw(body, key).map(as_text).unwrap_or_default()`
- `json_int`: `json_get_raw(body, key).map(as_int).unwrap_or(i32::MIN)`
- `json_long`: `json_get_raw(body, key).map(as_long).unwrap_or(i64::MIN)`
- `json_float`: `json_get_raw(body, key).map(as_float).unwrap_or(f64::NAN)`
- `json_bool`: `json_get_raw(body, key).map(as_bool).unwrap_or(false)`
- `json_items`: `json_array_items(body)` → build a `vector<text>` via `stores.text_vector`
- `json_nested`: `json_get_raw(body, key).unwrap_or_default().to_string()`

**Step 5 — Feature gate** (`src/native.rs` or `src/main.rs`):
Register the H2 natives only when compiled with `--features http`.  Without the feature,
calling any `json_*` function raises a compile-time error:
`"json_text requires the 'http' Cargo feature"`.

*Tests:*
- Valid JSON object: each extractor returns the correct value.
- Missing key: returns zero/empty/null-sentinel without panic.
- Invalid JSON body: returns zero/empty/null-sentinel without panic.
- Nested object value: `json_nested` returns a string parseable by `json_int` etc.
- `json_items` on a 3-element array returns a `vector<text>` of length 3.
- Unicode and `\"` escapes inside string values are handled correctly.

**Effort:** Small–Medium (new `json.rs` ~80 lines + 7 native functions; no new dependency)
**Target:** 0.8.4
**Depends on:** H1 (for the `http` feature gate pattern)

---

### H3  `from_json` codegen — scalar struct fields
**Sources:** [WEB_SERVICES.md](WEB_SERVICES.md) § Approach B, Phase 2
**Description:** For each `#json`-annotated struct whose fields are all primitive types
(`text`, `integer`, `long`, `float`, `single`, `boolean`, `character`), the compiler
synthesises a `from_json(body: text) -> T` function.  The result is a normal callable
fn-ref: `User.from_json` can be passed to `map` without any special syntax.
**Fix path:**

**Step 1 — Synthesis** (`src/state/typedef.rs`):
After H2 is in place, extend the `#json` synthesis pass (H1 Step 2) to also emit
`from_json`.  For each field, select the extractor by type:

| Loft type | Extractor call |
|-----------|---------------|
| `text` | `json_text(body, "field_name")` |
| `integer` | `json_int(body, "field_name")` |
| `long` | `json_long(body, "field_name")` |
| `float` / `single` | `json_float(body, "field_name")` |
| `boolean` | `json_bool(body, "field_name")` |
| `character` | first char of `json_text(body, "field_name")` |

The synthesised `from_json` body is a struct-literal expression using the above calls.
Fields not in the table (nested structs, enums, vectors) are silently skipped in this
phase (H5 adds them).

**Step 2 — fn-ref validation** (`src/state/compile.rs` or `src/state/codegen.rs`):
Verify that `Type.from_json` resolves as a callable fn-ref with type
`fn(text) -> Type`, so it can be passed directly to `json_items(...).map(...)` and
`json_items(...).filter(...)`.

*Tests:*
- `User.from_json(body)` returns a struct with all fields set from JSON.
- `json_items(resp.body).map(User.from_json)` returns a `vector<User>`.
- Absent JSON key sets the field to its zero value (0, "", false).
- Struct with a nested `#json` struct field compiles without error (nested field gets zero value until H5).

**Effort:** Medium (typedef synthesiser + fn-ref type check)
**Target:** 0.8.4
**Depends on:** H1, H2

---

### H4  HTTP client stdlib and `HttpResponse`
**Sources:** [WEB_SERVICES.md](WEB_SERVICES.md) § Approach B, stdlib additions; PROBLEMS #55
**Description:** Add blocking HTTP functions to `default/04_web.loft` backed by `ureq`.
All functions return `HttpResponse` — a plain struct — so there is no thread-local status
state and the API is parallel-safe (see PROBLEMS #55).
**Fix path:**

**Step 1 — `HttpResponse` struct** (`default/04_web.loft`):
```loft
pub struct HttpResponse {
    status: integer
    body:   text
}

pub fn ok(self: HttpResponse) -> boolean {
    self.status >= 200 and self.status < 300
}
// Mirror the File read interface so HTTP sources are interchangeable with
// file sources in any function that processes text.
pub fn content(self: HttpResponse) -> text {
    self.body
}
pub fn lines(self: HttpResponse) -> vector<text> {
    self.body.split('\n')  // strips \r so CRLF bodies match LF bodies
}
```
No `#rust` needed; all three methods are plain loft.  `lines()` uses the same
CRLF-stripping logic as `File.lines()` — HTTP/1.1 bodies frequently use CRLF.

**Optical similarity with `File`:** the shared method names let processing
functions accept either source without modification:
```loft
fn process(rows: vector<text>) { ... }
process(file("local/data.txt").lines());
process(http_get("https://example.com/data").lines());
```

**Step 2 — HTTP functions declaration** (`default/04_web.loft`):
```loft
// Body-less requests
pub fn http_get(url: text) -> HttpResponse;
pub fn http_delete(url: text) -> HttpResponse;

// Body requests (body is a text string, typically to_json() output)
pub fn http_post(url: text, body: text) -> HttpResponse;
pub fn http_put(url: text, body: text) -> HttpResponse;
pub fn http_patch(url: text, body: text) -> HttpResponse;

// With explicit headers (each entry: "Name: Value")
pub fn http_get_h(url: text, headers: vector<text>) -> HttpResponse;
pub fn http_post_h(url: text, body: text, headers: vector<text>) -> HttpResponse;
pub fn http_put_h(url: text, body: text, headers: vector<text>) -> HttpResponse;
```

**Step 3 — Rust implementation** (`src/native_http.rs`):
Use `ureq::get(url).call()` / `.send_string(body)`.  Parse each `"Name: Value"` header
entry by splitting at the first `:`.  On network error, connection refused, or timeout,
return `HttpResponse { status: 0, body: "" }` — never panic.  Set a default timeout of
30 seconds.
```rust
fn http_get(url: &str) -> HttpResponse {
    match ureq::get(url).call() {
        Ok(resp) => HttpResponse {
            status: resp.status() as i32,
            body:   resp.into_string().unwrap_or_default(),
        },
        Err(_) => HttpResponse { status: 0, body: String::new() },
    }
}
```

**Step 4 — Content-Type default**:
`http_post` and `http_put` set `Content-Type: application/json` automatically when the
body is non-empty (the common case).  Callers who need a different content type use the
`_h` variants to supply their own `Content-Type` header.

*Tests (run with a local mock server or httpbin.org):*
- `http_get("https://httpbin.org/get").ok()` is `true`.
- `http_get("https://httpbin.org/status/404").status` is `404`.
- `http_post` with a JSON body returns the echoed body from `/post`.
- Network failure (bad URL) returns `HttpResponse { status: 0, body: "" }`.
- Header variants set the supplied headers (verify via httpbin.org `/headers`).

**Effort:** Medium (`ureq` integration + 8 native functions)
**Target:** 0.8.4
**Depends on:** H2 (for the `http` Cargo feature; `ureq` added there)

### H5  Nested/array/enum `from_json` and integration tests
**Sources:** [WEB_SERVICES.md](WEB_SERVICES.md) § Approach B, Phases 3–4
**Description:** Extend the H3 `from_json` synthesiser to handle nested `#json` structs,
`vector<T>` array fields, and plain enum fields.  Add an integration test suite that calls
real HTTP endpoints and verifies the full round-trip.
**Fix path:**

**Step 1 — Nested `#json` struct fields** (`src/state/typedef.rs`):
For a field `addr: Address` where `Address` is `#json`-annotated, emit:
```loft
addr: Address.from_json(json_nested(body, "addr"))
```
The compiler must verify that `Address` is `#json` at the point of synthesis; if not,
emit: `"field 'addr' has type Address which is not annotated with #json"`.

**Step 2 — `vector<T>` array fields** (`src/state/typedef.rs`):
For a field `items: vector<Item>` where `Item` is `#json`, emit:
```loft
items: json_items(json_nested(body, "items")).map(Item.from_json)
```
This relies on `map` with fn-refs, which already works.  If `Item` is not `#json`, emit
a compile error.

**Step 3 — Plain enum fields** (`src/state/typedef.rs`):
For a field `status: Status` where `Status` is a plain (non-struct) enum, emit a `match`
on the string value:
```loft
status: match json_text(body, "status") {
    "Active"   => Status::Active,
    "Inactive" => Status::Inactive,
    _          => Status::Active,   // first variant as default
}
```
The default fallback uses the first variant; a compile-time warning notes it.
Struct-enum variants in JSON (e.g. `{"type": "Paid", "amount": 42}`) are not supported
in this phase — a compile error is emitted if a struct-enum field appears in a `#json` struct.

**Step 4 — `not null` field validation** (`src/state/typedef.rs`):
Fields declared `not null` whose JSON key is absent should emit a runtime warning (via the
logger) and keep the zero value rather than panicking.  This matches loft's general approach
of never crashing on bad data.

**Step 5 — Integration test suite** (`tests/web/`):
Write loft programs that call public stable APIs and assert on the response.  Tests should
be skipped if the `http` feature is not compiled in or if the network is unavailable:
- `GET https://httpbin.org/json` → parse known struct, assert fields.
- `POST https://httpbin.org/post` with JSON body → assert echoed body round-trips.
- `GET https://httpbin.org/status/500` → `resp.ok()` is `false`, `resp.status` is `500`.
- Nested struct: `GET https://httpbin.org/json` contains a nested `slideshow` object.
- Array field: `GET https://httpbin.org/json` contains a `slides` array.

**Effort:** Medium–High (3 codegen extensions + integration test infrastructure)
**Target:** 0.8.4
**Depends on:** H3, H4

## R — Repository

Standalone `loft` repository created (2026-03-16).  The remaining R item is the
workspace split needed before starting the Web IDE.

---

### R1  Workspace split (pre-W1 only — defer until IDE work begins)
**Description:** When W1 (WASM Foundation) is started, split the single crate into a Cargo
workspace so `loft-core` can be compiled to both native and `cdylib` (WA1SM) targets
without pulling CLI code into the WASM bundle:
```
Cargo.toml                     (workspace root)
loft-core/                 (all src/ except main.rs, gendoc.rs; crate-type = ["cdylib","rlib"])
loft-cli/                  ([[bin]] loft; depends on loft-core)
loft-gendoc/               ([[bin]] gendoc; depends on loft-core)
ide/                           (W2+: index.html, src/*.js, sw.js, manifest.json)
```
This change is a **prerequisite for W1** and should happen at the same time, not before.
For 1.0 the single-crate layout is correct and should not be changed early.
**Effort:** Small (Cargo workspace wiring; no logic changes)
**Depends on:** repo creation (done); gates W1
**Target:** 1.0.0

---

## W — Web IDE

A fully serverless, single-origin HTML application that lets users write, run, and
explore Loft programs in a browser without installing anything.  The existing Rust
interpreter is compiled to WebAssembly via a new `wasm` Cargo feature; the IDE shell
is plain ES-module JavaScript with no required build step after the WASM is compiled
once.  Full design in [WEB_IDE.md](WEB_IDE.md).

---

### W1  WASM Foundation
**Sources:** [WEB_IDE.md](WEB_IDE.md) — M1
**Severity/Value:** High — nothing else in Tier W is possible without this
**Description:** Compile the interpreter to WASM and expose a typed JS API.
Requires four bounded Rust changes, all behind `#[cfg(feature="wasm")]`:
1. `Cargo.toml` — `wasm` feature gating `wasm-bindgen`, `serde`, `serde-wasm-bindgen`; add `crate-type = ["cdylib","rlib"]`
2. `src/diagnostics.rs` — add `DiagEntry { level, file, line, col, message }` and `structured: Vec<DiagEntry>`; populate from `Lexer::diagnostic()` which already has `position: Position`
3. `src/fill.rs` — `op_print` writes to a `thread_local` `String` buffer instead of `print!()`
4. `src/parser/mod.rs` — virtual FS `thread_local HashMap<String,String>` checked before the real filesystem so `use` statements resolve from browser-supplied files
5. `src/wasm.rs` (new) — `compile_and_run(files: JsValue) -> JsValue` and `get_symbols(files: JsValue) -> JsValue`

JS deliverable: `ide/src/wasm-bridge.js` with `initWasm()` + `compileAndRun()`.
JS tests (4): hello-world, compile-error with position, multi-file `use`, runtime output capture.
**Effort:** Medium (Rust changes bounded; most risk is in virtual-FS wiring)
**Depends on:** R1
**Target:** 1.0.0

---

### W2  Editor Shell
**Sources:** [WEB_IDE.md](WEB_IDE.md) — M2
**Severity/Value:** High — the visible IDE; needed by all later W items
**Description:** A single `index.html` users can open directly (no bundler).
- `ide/src/loft-language.js` — CodeMirror 6 `StreamLanguage` tokenizer: keywords, types, string interpolation `{...}`, line/block comments, numbers
- `ide/src/editor.js` — CodeMirror 6 instance with line numbers, bracket matching, `setDiagnostics()` for gutter icons and underlines
- Layout: toolbar (project switcher + Run button), editor left, Console + Problems panels bottom

JS tests (5): keyword token, string interpolation span, line comment, type names, number literal.
**Effort:** Medium (CodeMirror 6 setup + Loft grammar)
**Depends on:** W1
**Target:** 1.0.0

---

### W3  Symbol Navigation
**Sources:** [WEB_IDE.md](WEB_IDE.md) — M3
**Severity/Value:** Medium — go-to-definition and find-usages; significant IDE quality uplift
**Description:**
- `src/wasm.rs`: implement `get_symbols()` — walk `parser.data.def_names` and variable tables; return `[{name, kind, file, line, col, usages:[{file,line,col}]}]`
- `ide/src/symbols.js`: `buildIndex()`, `findAtPosition()`, `formatUsageList()`
- Editor: Ctrl+click → jump to definition; hover tooltip showing kind + file
- Outline panel (sidebar): lists all functions, structs, enums; clicking navigates

JS tests (3): find function definition, format usage list, no-match returns null.
**Effort:** Medium (Rust symbol walk + JS index)
**Depends on:** W1, W2
**Target:** 1.0.0

---

### W4  Multi-File Projects
**Sources:** [WEB_IDE.md](WEB_IDE.md) — M4
**Severity/Value:** High — essential for any real program; single-file is a toy
**Description:** All projects persist in IndexedDB.  Project schema: `{id, name, modified, files:[{name,content}]}`.
- `ide/src/projects.js` — `listProjects()`, `loadProject(id)`, `saveProject(project)`, `deleteProject(id)`; auto-save on edit (debounced 2 s)
- UI: project-switcher dropdown, "New project" dialog, file-tree panel, tab bar, `use` filename auto-complete

JS tests (4): save/load roundtrip, list all projects, delete removes entry, auto-save updates timestamp.
**Effort:** Medium (IndexedDB wrapper + UI wiring)
**Depends on:** W2
**Target:** 1.0.0

---

### W5  Documentation & Examples Browser
**Sources:** [WEB_IDE.md](WEB_IDE.md) — M5
**Severity/Value:** Medium — documentation access without leaving the IDE; example projects lower barrier to entry
**Description:**
- Build-time script `ide/scripts/bundle-docs.js`: parse `doc/*.html` → `assets/docs-bundle.json` (headings + prose + code blocks)
- `ide/src/docs.js` — renders bundle with substring search
- `ide/src/examples.js` — registers `tests/docs/*.loft` as one-click example projects ("Open as project")
- Right-sidebar tabs: **Docs** | **Examples** | **Outline**

Run the bundler automatically from `build.sh` after `cargo run --bin gendoc`.
**Effort:** Small–Medium (bundler script + panel UI)
**Depends on:** W2
**Target:** 1.0.0

---

### W6  Export, Import & PWA
**Sources:** [WEB_IDE.md](WEB_IDE.md) — M6
**Severity/Value:** Medium — closes the loop between browser and local development
**Description:**
- `ide/src/export.js`: `exportZip(project)` → `Blob` (JSZip); `importZip(blob)` → project object; drag-and-drop import
- Export ZIP layout: `<name>/src/*.loft`, `<name>/lib/*.loft` (if any), `README.md`, `run.sh`, `run.bat` — matches `loft`'s `use` resolution path so unzip + run works locally
- `ide/sw.js` — service worker pre-caches all IDE assets; offline after first load
- `ide/manifest.json` — PWA manifest
- URL sharing: single-file programs encoded as `#code=<base64>` in URL

JS tests (4): ZIP contains `src/main.loft`, `run.sh` invokes `loft`, import roundtrip preserves content, URL encode/decode.
**Effort:** Small–Medium (JSZip + service worker)
**Depends on:** W4
**Target:** 1.0.0
