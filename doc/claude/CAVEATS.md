# Known Caveats

Verifiable edge cases and limitations that affect users or block tests.
Each entry has a reproducer and the test(s) that exercise it, so a release
build can be retested quickly.

**Maintenance rules:**
- Remove an entry when the underlying issue is fully fixed and the test passes
  without workarounds.
- Keep entries short — this is a quick-lookup document for release retesting.
  Fix designs, root-cause analysis, and implementation plans belong in
  [PLANNING.md](PLANNING.md), [PROBLEMS.md](PROBLEMS.md), or the relevant
  design doc.  Each entry here should have at most: one-line description,
  reproducer, test reference, workaround, and a pointer to where the fix is
  planned.

## C3 — WASM backend: threading not implemented

The `--native-wasm` backend currently lacks support for threading.
File I/O, random numbers, time functions, and dynamic function references (`CallRef`) are
now all implemented (W1.15, W1.16, W1.17, W1.19, W1.20 — all 0.8.3).

**Affected files:** `tests/wrap.rs` — `WASM_SKIP` array:

| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `19-threading.loft` | WASM threading model differs; W1.18 not yet landed |

**Previously skipped — now passing:**

| File | Fixed by |
|------|----------|
| `06-function.loft` | W1.15 — `output_call_ref` dispatch table |
| `13-file.loft` | W1.16 — `OpDelete`/`OpMoveFile`/`OpMkdir`/`OpMkdirAll` in `codegen_runtime` |
| `18-locks.loft` | W1.17 — lock functions in `CODEGEN_RUNTIME_FNS` |
| `21-random.loft` | W1.19 — WASM `rand`/`rand_indices` bridge |
| `22-time.loft` | W1.20 — `host_time_now()` via `std::time::SystemTime` |

**Workaround:** use the interpreter (`cargo run --bin loft`) instead of `--native-wasm`.
**Remaining work:** W1.18 (threading) in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) (0.8.3).

## C7 — `spacial<T>` not implemented

The spatial index collection type is declared but all operations panic at
runtime.  A compile-time error is emitted for basic usage, but edge cases
may still reach the runtime panics.

**Test:** `tests/scripts/36-parse-errors.loft` — `@EXPECT_ERROR` for spacial.
**Planned fix:** A4 (spatial index operations), targeted for 1.1+.
**Docs:** [PROBLEMS.md](PROBLEMS.md) § Issue 22.

## C31 — Closures in struct fields not yet supported

Closures in **vectors** now work (both capturing and non-capturing).
Storing closures as **struct fields** is not yet supported — requires
`Type::Function` handling in the struct field write path.

**Workaround:** use vectors or function arguments to pass closures.
**Planned fix:** deferred to 1.1+.

---

## C32 — Captured parameter "never read" warning is false for cross-scope closures

When a function parameter is captured by a closure that is returned from the
function, the parameter IS read (by the capture) but the use-analysis does not
track `SetText` on a closure record as a read.  The `Variable.captured` flag
suppresses the "never read" warning, but the dead-assignment analysis still
does not see the capture as a use.

**Reproducer:**
```loft
fn make_greeter(prefix: text) -> fn(text) -> text {
    fn(name: text) -> text { "{prefix} {name}" }
}
// No warning (suppressed by captured flag).
// But: x = "a"; f = fn() { x }; x = "b";
// Dead-assignment warning for x="a" fires even though it was captured.
```

**Impact:** cosmetic — the dead-assignment warning is arguably correct (the
capture happens before the overwrite, and the captured value is `"a"` not `"b"`).
**Planned fix:** none — accepted as a language semantic.  Capture-at-definition
is the intended behaviour and the dead-assignment warning is informative.

## C33 — Interfaces: factory methods (`fn zero() -> Self`) not supported

An interface method without a `self` parameter (a factory/constructor) cannot be
declared.  The parser requires at least one `Self`-typed `self` parameter in every
interface method body.

**Reproducer:**
```loft
interface Addable {
    fn OpAdd(self: Self, other: Self) -> Self
    fn zero() -> Self        // ERROR: factory method not yet supported
}
```

**Impact:** `sum`-style generic functions that need an identity element must instead
accept `zero: T` as an explicit argument (the workaround used in the stdlib).
**Workaround:** pass the identity value as an extra parameter:
```loft
fn sum<T: Addable>(v: vector<T>, zero: T) -> T { ... }
```
**Mitigation (I12.diag, 0.8.3):** the compile error now includes the workaround hint.
**Full fix:** I12 (factory-method restriction phase 2). Target: 1.1+.

---

## C34 — Interfaces: left-side concrete operand in binary operators not supported

When a bounded generic `T` is the **right** operand of a binary operator and a
concrete type is on the left (`3 * t`), the compiler does not resolve the operator
through the interface.  Only `T op T` and `T op Concrete` (where `T` is on the
left) work.

**Reproducer:**
```loft
interface Scalable { fn scale(self: Self, factor: integer) -> Self }
fn double<T: Scalable>(x: T) -> T { 2 * x }   // ERROR: 2 is concrete, x is T
fn double<T: Scalable>(x: T) -> T { x.scale(2) }  // OK: method call workaround
```

**Impact:** expressions where a primitive literal or concrete value must be the
left operand fail to compile inside a bounded generic.  Rewrite as a method call
on the `T` value or put `T` on the left.
**Workaround:** define and use the operator with `T` on the left: `x * 2` instead
of `2 * x`; or use a named method (`x.scale(2)`).
**Mitigation (I8.5.diag, 0.8.3):** the compiler now detects the concrete-left/generic-right
pattern and emits a specific error naming the ordering problem and suggesting the workaround.
**Full fix:** I8.5 (mixed-type operator, concrete left side). Target: 1.1+.

## C37 — Generic struct-type returns: debug store-lifetime assertion

Generic functions over struct types (C35/C36/C37) now work correctly in
release builds.  In debug builds, the returned DbRef borrows a position
inside the input vector's store.  When the vector is freed before the
return value is used, the debug `valid()` check fires "Use after free".

**Impact:** debug-only — release builds produce correct results.
**Root cause:** the generic function returns a borrowed DbRef from the vector
instead of deep-copying the struct record.  Similar to the T1.8c tuple
deep-copy issue.
**Planned fix:** deep-copy struct return values from generic functions,
similar to `OpCopyRecord` in tuple destructuring.  No milestone assigned yet.
