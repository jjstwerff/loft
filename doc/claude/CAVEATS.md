# Known Caveats

Verifiable edge cases and limitations that affect users or block tests.
Each entry has a reproducer and the test(s) that exercise it, so a release
build can be retested quickly.

**Maintenance rules:**
- Remove an entry when the underlying issue is fully fixed and the test passes
  without workarounds.
- Keep entries short — this is a quick-lookup document for release retesting.
  Fix designs, root-cause analysis, and implementation plans belong in
  [PLANNING.md](PLANNING.md), [PROBLEMS.md](PROBLEMS.md), or the relevant
  design doc.  Each entry here should have at most: one-line description,
  reproducer, test reference, workaround, and a pointer to where the fix is
  planned.

## C3 — WASM backend: threading not implemented

The `--native-wasm` backend currently lacks support for threading.
File I/O, random numbers, time functions, and dynamic function references (`CallRef`) are
now all implemented (W1.15, W1.16, W1.17, W1.19, W1.20 — all 0.8.3).

**Affected files:** `tests/wrap.rs` — `WASM_SKIP` array:

| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `19-threading.loft` | WASM threading model differs; W1.18 not yet landed |

**Previously skipped — now passing:**

| File | Fixed by |
|------|----------|
| `06-function.loft` | W1.15 — `output_call_ref` dispatch table |
| `13-file.loft` | W1.16 — `OpDelete`/`OpMoveFile`/`OpMkdir`/`OpMkdirAll` in `codegen_runtime` |
| `18-locks.loft` | W1.17 — lock functions in `CODEGEN_RUNTIME_FNS` |
| `21-random.loft` | W1.19 — WASM `rand`/`rand_indices` bridge |
| `22-time.loft` | W1.20 — `host_time_now()` via `std::time::SystemTime` |

**Workaround:** use the interpreter (`cargo run --bin loft`) instead of `--native-wasm`.
**Remaining work:** W1.18 (threading) in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) (0.8.3).

## C7 — `spacial<T>` not implemented

The spatial index collection type is declared but all operations panic at
runtime.  A compile-time error is emitted for basic usage, but edge cases
may still reach the runtime panics.

**Test:** `tests/scripts/36-parse-errors.loft` — `@EXPECT_ERROR` for spacial.
**Planned fix:** A4 (spatial index operations), targeted for 1.1+.
**Docs:** [PROBLEMS.md](PROBLEMS.md) § Issue 22.

## C12 — No exception handling

Runtime errors from `assert` and `panic` abort the program. There is no
`try`/`catch` or `Result` mechanism for structured error recovery.

**Reproducer:**
```loft
fn main() {
  // This aborts — no way to catch it:
  assert(false, "deliberate failure");
  // This line is never reached.
}
```

**Test:** none (cannot test abort from inside loft).
**Workaround:** validate inputs before operations; use `FileResult` for file I/O errors.
**Docs:** [00-vs-python.html](../00-vs-python.html) § No exception handling.
