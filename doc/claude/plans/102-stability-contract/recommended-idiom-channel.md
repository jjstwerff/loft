## What arc C is (and is not)

loft's promise is **absolute never-break + no usage telemetry**, which makes the callable surface a
**one-way ratchet**: you can *add* and *steer*, but you can never *prove* zero holdouts, so you can
never *remove*. So a "deprecation" here can never reach a removal — it is **recommended-idiom
signposting**, not a path to a break. Arc C is that channel. It has exactly two jobs:

1. **Steer** — a warning that says *"there is now a nicer way to write this"* (Goal F: the only
   channel allowed to bill the programmer, and even it bills nothing you must act on). The old idiom
   keeps working, identically, forever.
2. **Fold** — the collectible win of a steer is not surface shrinkage (impossible) but **fewer
   independent implementations**: reimplement the old name as a thin shim over the new primitive and
   delete the old code. *Every steer ships with its fold, or it buys nothing but more surface.*

Arc C is **not** the compat gate (that is C1, done, `loft api-surface`), **not** the registry
(B-registry / C2-C3), and **not** the contract-keyed behaviour split (C4). It is the smallest of the
mechanism arcs — one attribute, one gate, one lint — but it carries the plan's hardest *design*
question, Q3.

## The one invariant (design-protocol step 1)

> **A steer fires exactly when the compilation's OWNED source (the entry project) uses a
> `#superseded` idiom — never when the idiom-use is in imported-dependency or stdlib source; and
> every `#superseded("use Y")` symbol is implemented as a shim over Y.**

Two halves, each a single carried fact so it cannot be re-derived per site:

- **The fire-site half (Q3):** the gate reads ONE fact — *is the source currently being compiled the
  entry project, or a dependency?* — which loft already carries per source (`Definition.source`;
  `MAIN_SOURCE` = the entry, `STD_SOURCE` = stdlib, a `use`d library = its own resolved source, tagged
  a dependency by the package-path-prefix map). The steer fires iff the CALLER's source is owned.
- **The fold half (C5):** `#superseded("use Y")` on symbol X is a machine-checkable promise that X's
  body is a shim over Y. A `make ci` lint enforces it, so a steer cannot ship un-folded.

## Q3 — whose obligation, resolved (the crux)

**The question** (README open-question 3): C86 changed the meaning of code libraries had *already
shipped*. A warning at **loft-build** time reaches the loft team (they already know); at
**library-compile** time reaches the author (who can act); at **consumer-compile** time reaches the
wrong person (a consumer cannot fix the library). *Where does it fire?*

**The answer is a provenance gate on the CALLER, not the callee.** A steer fires only when the source
*making the call* is the compilation's entry project (`owned`), never when it is a resolved
dependency or the stdlib. This reaches the right person **structurally**, in every case:

| Who is compiling | Whose source is `owned` (entry) | Steer on a superseded idiom fires? | Right person? |
|---|---|---|---|
| A user writing a program | their program | **yes** — on their own old-idiom use | ✅ they can act |
| A **library author** building/testing their lib | the library | **yes** — on the lib's old-idiom use | ✅ they can act |
| A **consumer** importing that library | their program (the lib is a dependency) | **no** on the lib's internal idiom; **yes** on the consumer's own code | ✅ never nagged for a lib they can't fix |
| loft's own `make ci` on the stdlib | the stdlib is `STD_SOURCE`, exempt | **no** (stdlib already warning-exempt) | ✅ n/a |

The load-bearing observation that makes this non-trivial: **a consumer DOES re-parse a library's
`.loft` source** (libraries ship as source for the interpreter + cross-target). Without the gate, a
library's internal use of an old idiom would warn *the consumer* on every build — the exact
"wrong-person" failure. The gate suppresses it because the library's source is not `MAIN_SOURCE` in
the consumer's compilation. This is the same shape as the existing `self.default` stdlib exemption,
generalised from two-way (stdlib / not) to the provenance already carried per source (entry /
dependency / stdlib).

**Delivery (the README's second half of C's open status).** The steer's primary channel is the
**dev-time compile warning** — the author sees it on `loft run` / `loft check` / `loft test` of their
own project or library. That is sufficient and correctly-targeted by the gate above. A **secondary**
channel — the registry migration-scan (arc B-registry) — statically scans every *published* library
for superseded-idiom use, giving the OWNER the ecosystem map ("which public libs still use old idiom
X") to **prioritise which folds are worth doing** and to target an author-facing nudge. Two channels,
distinct audiences: dev-compile → the code's author (act now); registry scan → the loft owner
(prioritise). Neither ever reaches a consumer about a dependency's internals.

**The contract-keyed variant (C86's actual class) is C4, not the MVP.** C86 was a *semantic* change
(plain-bind now copies), which **cannot be folded** (the old behaviour is not expressible over the
new — folding's limit, below). A semantic change is handled by the **contract-keyed escape valve**
(C4 / leg 3): the old behaviour is preserved under the declared `contract`, and the author is steered
to the new idiom *when they bump contract*. That author-alert reuses arc C's SAME provenance gate and
emission, but its trigger is a contract bump, not a bare `#superseded`. So the MVP builds the
**superset idiom steer**; the contract-keyed author-alert is a thin C4-triggered reuse of it,
cross-referenced, built when the first genuine keyed change lands (same "when genuinely needed" rule
as C4's behaviour split).

## The re-assertion count (design-protocol step 2) — N = 1 everywhere

- **Steer emission:** ONE chokepoint — call resolution (`call_nr` / `call`, `src/parser/mod.rs`),
  the same single point every fn/method/operator call routes through (the site the call-arg N-Store
  check already lives at). It reads the resolved def's `superseded` field + the caller's provenance.
  No per-call-form spray.
- **Provenance:** ONE carried fact (`self.data.source` vs `MAIN_SOURCE` / dependency), not
  re-derived. Omitting it cannot silently mis-target — the gate is one predicate.
- **The fold check:** ONE `make ci` pass over the parsed `Data`.

So `N × silence` = 0: there is one emission site, one gate, one lint. (The one honest widening: a
superseded *type/field* use — not a call — would need a second emission point at type-resolution.
The MVP scopes to fn/method/operator steers, the common "use method Y instead" case; type steers are
a later increment reading the *same* provenance fact — see step 7.)

## Falsification — how it breaks (design-protocol steps 3–4)

- **Claim: "the gate reaches the right person in every case."** Probed in the Q3 table above; the
  load-bearing sub-claim ("a consumer re-parses library source, so the gate is required") is
  VERIFIED against the tree (libraries distribute `.loft` source, parsed at load). Falsification
  target for the build: a fixture where a *dependency's* source uses a `#superseded` idiom must emit
  **zero** steers when compiled by a consumer, and the SAME source must emit the steer when compiled
  as its own entry (the author case). Both are positive controls in step 3.
- **Claim: "every superseded symbol can be folded."** FALSE in general — a semantically-*different*
  replacement cannot be folded (folding's limit). So `#superseded` carries a contract: **the
  successor Y is a behavioural superset of X.** The fold lint enforces that X is *implemented via* Y
  (a structural check), but it CANNOT prove semantic equivalence — the author asserts the superset.
  This bounds the attribute's honest use: a semantic change is contract-keyed (C4), never a bare
  `#superseded`. The lint catches the *mechanical* failure (a steer with no fold); the superset claim
  is the author's, documented at the marker.
- **Claim: "a new steer is never a breaking change" (why the channel survives the freeze).** A
  `#superseded` marking adds a *warning* to code that used to compile clean. Per
  [COMPATIBILITY.md § Warnings are not a covered surface](../../COMPATIBILITY.md) (owner ruling
  2026-07-14: warnings are never a contract breakage), a new warning breaks nothing — so the steer
  channel is the one path that stays open *past* 1.0 (Goal F). This is load-bearing: it is *why* arc
  C can keep operating after the freeze while every other surface is frozen. Falsification target: a
  build that treats warnings as errors is opting into churn the contract does not owe — so the steer
  must be a `Level::Warning`, never an error, and must be silenceable per the standard warning
  toggles.
- **Over-unification guard (step 4) — the cleanest claim: "arc C is one attribute + one gate + one
  lint."** Attacked: (a) type/field steers need a second emission point → scoped OUT of the MVP
  (step 7), not absorbed falsely. (b) The contract-keyed author-alert (C86's class) *looks* like the
  same channel but has a different trigger (a contract bump, not a bare marker) and cannot fold →
  routed to C4, not absorbed. (c) A steer whose successor is in a *different* library (cross-package
  fold) — the fold lint must resolve Y across the loaded `Data`, and if Y is unresolvable the marker
  is rejected at parse (a dangling steer is a build error on the AUTHOR's side, never a consumer's).
  Each near-absorption is named and either scoped out or handled, not waved in.

## The safe small steps (the commit ladder)

Inert-first, each step complete + verifiable before the next (PLANNING.md § goal 5). The channel is
**inert until the first symbol is marked `#superseded`**, so most steps are byte-identical for every
existing program — the risk is concentrated in one place (the provenance gate, step 3) and the proof
in the dogfood (step 6).

| # | Step | What lands | Verify (positive control) | E |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ✅ **LANDED (2026-07-16). The `#superseded` attribute — PARSE + STORE, inert.** `Definition.superseded: String` (**empty = not superseded**, matching the `cap`/`native` empty-string-sentinel convention — chosen over `Option<String>` to match the sibling def-level fields + keep the string round-trip simple). **Payload is the BARE successor symbol** (`#superseded "write_through"`, NOT a free-text phrase like `"use write_through"`) — locked in so step 4's lint resolves Y directly with no phrase-parsing, and the future warning renders "…use `write_through`…". Parsed in `definitions.rs` beside `#null_safe` (author-available, not stdlib-only; a missing string is a parse error). Full round-trip mirroring @PLN46's `null_safe`: `DEF_SUPERSEDED` store slot (text ref at offset 152; the three trailing bools shift +4, stride 155→159) + JSON (`ir_schema`) + the `ir.loft` mirror + `ir_schema_gen`. **Nothing reads the field** → byte-identical bytecode + native Rust (proven: HEAD~1 vs HEAD introspect diff empty). | ✅ `superseded_survives_store_round_trip` (parse → store → JSON); layout asserts updated; a marked fn round-trips, an unmarked one is `""`; introspect byte-identical on both backends | S |
| 2 | ✅ **LANDED (2026-07-16). The provenance predicate.** Two methods on `Data`: `source_is_owned(source) = (source == MAIN_SOURCE)` (the general fact — entry vs a `2..` dependency vs `STD_SOURCE`) and `caller_source_is_owned() = source_is_owned(self.source)` (the current-compile-source form step 3 reads at a call site). Names a fact loft already carries; **no behaviour change** (no caller yet). Boundary documented on `source_is_owned`: loft's entry is a single `MAIN_SOURCE` file + `use`d libs; a multi-source entry package would need the package-path-prefix map. | ✅ `source_ownership_distinguishes_entry_dependency_stdlib`: an entry def (MAIN_SOURCE) → owned; a def parsed at source 2 (what a `use`d lib gets) → NOT owned; stdlib → NOT owned; `caller_source_is_owned()` tracks the current parse source | S |
| 3 | ✅ **LANDED (2026-07-16). Steer emission — GATED, the one risky step.** At `call_nr` (the shared call chokepoint), a resolved call FROM OWNED source (`self.data.caller_source_is_owned()`) to a `superseded`-marked def emits `Level::Warning` *"`X` is superseded — use `Y` (the old form keeps working)"* (`X` shown with the `n_` prefix stripped). Second-pass + `report` only (fires once per call site); strings cloned before the diagnostic to keep `&self.data`/`&mut self.lexer` disjoint. Gate `LOFT_NO_STEER` (`keys::steer_enabled`, default **on**, opt-out), mirroring `nullflow_enabled`; inert until a symbol is marked (suite byte-identical). Both backends share the parser + the pre-branch diagnostic render, so they surface it identically — NOTE it is a parse-time diagnostic, so a whole-program WARM-cache hit skips it (like every inline parse warning; the author sees it on every cold compile, `LOFT_NO_CACHE=1` forces cold). | ✅ `steer_fires_from_owned_source_silent_from_dependency` (parser unit, backend-agnostic — owned warns, source-2 silent, SAME mechanism); `tests/steer_warning.rs` (steer fires on interpret AND `--native`; `LOFT_NO_STEER=1` silences) | **M** |
| 4 | ✅ **LANDED (2026-07-16). The fold lint (C5.2).** `use_analysis::superseded_fold_diagnostics` — a pass over `Data` (wired into the compile path beside `warn_dead_stores`; runs in `make ci`) over every `#superseded "Y"` symbol X **in owned source** (same provenance gate — a consumer never sees a dependency's fold issues): (a) resolve Y (X's own source, then `STD_SOURCE`) — unresolvable ⇒ hard `Level::Error`, the compile fails (a dangling steer never ships); (b) X's body must CALL Y (`code.any_node` for `Call(y_nr,…)`) — un-folded ⇒ advisory `Level::Warning` (promote to a hard `make ci` gate once the surface is clean). Inert until a symbol is marked ⇒ suite byte-identical. | ✅ `fold_lint_flags_dangling_and_unfolded_superseded` (folded → clean · un-folded → warns · dangling → errors); end-to-end: a dangling successor exits non-zero, an un-folded one warns + runs | S–M |
| 5 | ✅ **LANDED (2026-07-16). Default-on confirmation + docs.** Inertness MEASURED — the full suite ran with steps 1–4 wired in and NO symbol marked: 2977 passed, the only fails the 3 known heavy-serial flakes, zero new warnings (byte-identical). The mechanism (`#superseded` attribute + the owned-source steer + the enforced fold) is documented in **[COMPATIBILITY.md § Folding](../../COMPATIBILITY.md)** (the canonical home — LOFT.md has no definition-attribute section, its `#…` are loop attributes); the **`LOFT_NO_STEER`** toggle is in `CLAUDE.md`'s diagnostic-toggle reference. | ✅ suite zero new warnings (inert); COMPATIBILITY.md § Folding + the toggle ref updated | S |
| 6 | **The first REAL steer (dogfood — the deliverable).** Pick ONE genuine stdlib superset pair where a nicer primitive already exists, mark the old name `#superseded "use Y"`, and **fold** it (reimplement the old name as a shim over Y, delete the old body). This proves the channel end-to-end and instantiates "every steer ships with its fold". Blast radius measured by the suite (owned-source callers of the old idiom now warn — fix or accept per site). | the folded old name still passes every existing test (behavioural superset held); owned callers warn; the fold lint is green on it; the registry libs (dependency source) do NOT warn | **M** |
| 7 | **(Later) type/field steers + the registry migration-scan.** Extend emission to a superseded *type/field* use at type-resolution (same provenance fact, second read point). Wire the registry scan (arc B-registry) to report which *published* libs use each `#superseded` idiom — the owner's fold-prioritisation map + author-facing nudge. Defer until the MVP proves out and B-registry exists. | a superseded type used in owned source warns; the scan lists public-lib users of a marked idiom | M |

**Shape:** keystone risk in **step 3** (the provenance gate — the Q3 resolution in code) and proof in
**step 6** (the first real fold, end-to-end, with the dependency-source-silent positive control).
Steps 1–2 are inert plumbing; 4–5 make the discipline enforceable; 7 is the ecosystem tie-in,
deferred. The whole MVP is steps 1–6, entirely in this repo.

## Folding's limit (the boundary the design must respect)

Folding works **only when Y is a genuine superset** — same observable semantics, nicer form. So:

- `#superseded` is for **preference steers over supersets** — "use `write_through` instead of the
  plain-bind idiom", "use `floor_mod` instead of the manual wrap". The old and new produce identical
  observable results; the fold is a pure refactor.
- A **semantic** replacement (the old behaviour is *not* expressible over the new — C86) is NOT an
  arc-C steer. It is **contract-keyed** (C4 / leg 3): loft carries both behaviours, keyed on the
  declared `contract`; the author sees the new idiom only when they bump contract. Arc C's channel is
  *reused* to deliver that author-alert (same owned-source gate), but the trigger and the "fold" (=
  contract-keying) are C4's, built when the first keyed change is genuinely needed.

Stating this boundary is load-bearing: it stops the elegant over-absorption of C86 into the bare
`#superseded` channel, where it would be a lie (the fold cannot exist).
