# @PLN90 phase B — DESIGN: the last-use move-elision (grounded in captured IR)

Scope + reframe: [phase-b-scope.md](phase-b-scope.md). This is the concrete, IR-grounded design
that scope's slice 1 (the loft-codegen gate) produces. Captured bytecode:
[bytecode-comparisons/phaseB-captures.txt](bytecode-comparisons/phaseB-captures.txt) (+ the three
`phaseB-*.loft` probes). Every claim below is read off that capture, not guessed.

## The one invariant (the hypothesis to enforce)

> A construction (`S { f: src }`) or record (`v[i] = e`, `o.f = src`) copy whose **source is a
> named var, provably dead after the copy** is lowered as a **store transfer** — the source's
> existing store *becomes* the field/element (no fresh field store, no element copy, no separate
> source-free). It is **value-identical** to the copy (never observable — C86: an elision, not a
> semantic), **leak- and double-free-free on both backends**, and a **surviving** source keeps its
> copy untouched.

This is C86's own last-use rule (`ElidePlan` is exactly this analysis) applied to two shapes it
does not yet cover. The *decision* already exists — the phase-A survival split classifies these as
`move: source consumed`. Phase B adds the **lowering**, not new analysis.

## Grounded: current → target (from the capture)

**Case A — construction, dead source** (`base=[10,20,30]; a=Bag{items:base}; a.items[1]`):

| current (copy-then-free) | target (move) |
|---|---|
| `OpDatabase(a)` — a's store, items **empty** | `OpDatabase(a)` — a's store, items **empty** |
| `OpAppendVector(a.items, base)` — **copy** store#2→store#3 | *(dropped)* |
| `OpFreeRef(a)` — frees a + a.items(store#3) | `OpFreeRef(a)` — frees a + a.items(**= store#2**) |
| `OpFreeRef(__vdb_1)` — frees base(store#2) | *(dropped — store#2 moved into a)* |
| — | **new:** `a.items := base` (transfer store#2's DbRef into the field) |

Net: **−1 store alloc, −1 element-copy, −1 free**; base's store-free *folds into* a's scope-exit
free. **Record case B (`a.items = base`) is worse today — TWO copies** (`base→__p154_rhs→a.items`);
the same transfer removes both. The efficiency target is the literal `Bag{items:[…]}` (one store,
field filled in place, no copy) — the move must match it.

## The chokepoint: one decision, read by three emit sites

`ElidePlan` (`use_analysis.rs`) already carries "this copy is elidable" for the var-buffer idiom,
consumed by `scopes::elide_borrows`/`elide_rewrite`. Phase B extends it: a **`MovePlan`** (or a new
`ElidePlan` variant) for a construction/record copy whose source is a dead named var. The plan is
computed **once** (from the survival `move` fact) and the three lowering sites **read** it — none
re-derives it (the design-protocol re-assertion count = **3**, all reading one fact):

1. **Suppress the field copy** — drop `OpAppendVector(field, src)` / the record-copy `OpCopyRecord`
   (+ the `__p154_rhs` temp + its append/clear for the record case).
2. **Emit the transfer** — `field := src`'s DbRef (the field's slot now holds the source's store
   handle). The exact op: a whole-vector/record **field-set-by-handle** (mirror how the local-var
   slot receives a moved store in the var-buffer elision — `elide_rewrite` re-points reads today;
   here we re-point the *field slot* to the source store). **Crux (the capture exposes it):**
   `OpDatabase(a)` already pre-allocates an **empty** `a.items` store (store#3 in the trace) so the
   current `OpAppendVector` has a target. The transfer must **not orphan store#3** — either alloc
   `a` with the field left NULL and set it to the source store, or **free the empty placeholder
   before adopting** (the exact pattern the #506 adopt-arm used: free the real distinct `_dst`
   before `var = _src`; `generation/dispatch.rs` + `displaced_owned_slots`). Skipping this is the
   F2 leak.
3. **Suppress the source-free** — drop `OpFreeRef(src)` at scope exit; the source store is now owned
   by the field and freed transitively when the container is freed.

Sites (1)+(3) are *removals* keyed on the plan; (2) is the one *addition*. This is the same
ownership-transfer class as the shipped var-buffer `ElidePlan`, so the free-side bookkeeping
(`scopes.rs` scope-exit frees, `displaced_owned_slots`) is the code to teach, not to invent.

## Both generators (the both-backends rule)

Interp (`src/state/codegen.rs` + the `scopes.rs` elide pass) and native (`src/generation/`) are
separate generators reading the same IR. The `MovePlan` is produced once in the post-parse pass
(`scopes::check`, where `elide_borrows` already runs); **both** backends then lower the transferred
field-set. A rung is closed only when BOTH emit the move and pass value+leak+poison. Capture the
native target Rust in slice 1b (the interp capture above is the spec for the shared IR; native's
`generation/` must emit the equivalent store-handle set + the dropped free).

## Boundary matrix (assert value + length + **leak + poison**, both backends)

`{construction S{f:src}, record v[i]=e, record o.f=src} × {source DEAD (must MOVE), source SURVIVES
(must COPY — C86), source MUTATED after (must COPY), source is a param (never dead — must COPY),
nested field s.a.b = src, source in a loop} × {interp, native}`.

- **DEAD** cells: 0 runtime copies (`LOFT_COPY_DUMP`), value identical, no leak, no double-free.
- **SURVIVES / MUTATED / param** cells: unchanged from today (still copy) — proves phase B touches
  only what C86 sanctions. These are the falsification cells: if a survivor elides, C86 is broken.
- **leak** must be checked *with value+length* (a move that drops the field reads leak-free but
  wrong; only value+length catches it).

## Failure modes → the guard that kills each (design-protocol)

| # | failure | why | guard |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | **double-free** — source freed by both the transfer-owner and the old `OpFreeRef(src)` | forgot to suppress site (3) | POISON + native leak-check on every DEAD cell; the plan MUST drop the source-free |
| F2 | **leak** — source store transferred but the field-free doesn't reach it | the field slot didn't actually adopt the store | `LOFT_STORES=warn` / `LOFT_NATIVE_LEAK_CHECK`; assert store count returns to base |
| F3 | **survivor elided** — a live source becomes the field's store, later read/mutation now aliases | the dead-source fact was wrong / too wide | the SURVIVES + MUTATED matrix cells (must still copy); this is the C86 boundary |
| F4 | **one backend moves, the other copies** | the plan lowered in only one generator | both-backends matrix; not landable until both move |
| F5 | **nested / aliased field** (`s.rows[i] = src`) transfers into an aliased slot | the field slot is itself a view | reject the un-transferable case cleanly (fall back to copy — loud, never silent) |

## B1.2 findings (built + verified — the detection, `LOFT_MOVE_ELIDE`)

`MovePlan` + `move_elidable_source` + `dump_move_plans` land in `use_analysis.rs` (gated,
byte-identical off; `analyze_fn` now returns a 3rd `Vec<MovePlan>`, callers unchanged via `.0`/`.1`).
Detection = the survival **move** fact + elision preconditions (not a param; owns a store —
`def_vdb`/`database_vars`). Verified on the probes: fires `make_dead` (Construct, `base`) and
`rec_move` (Record, `e` — a clean `OpCopyRecord(e, v[0])`, item-3 swap confirmed), **silent on both
survivors**. Corpus reach: **37 Construct + 65 Record** move-elidable sites. Two findings the
capture surfaced, to fold into B1.3:

- **Record shape splits.** A clean `v[i] = e` element-set IS one `OpCopyRecord` (source `e`, caught).
  But a **vector-field whole-replacement** `a.items = base` lowers to a **chained copy through a
  temp** — `__p154_rhs += base` (a var-buffer copyfill) then `a.items += __p154_rhs` — so the field
  append's source is `__p154_rhs`, not `base`; B1.2 does not catch it. It needs a **chained-source**
  widening (follow `field += tmp` where `tmp` was copyfilled from a dead owned `base`).
- **Ordering vs `elide_borrows`.** `dump_move_plans` runs in `scopes::check` **before**
  `elide_borrows`. The var-buffer `ElidePlan` inlines `__p154_rhs`→`base`; if move-detection ran
  *after* that inlining, the chained `a.items = base` would collapse to `a.items += base` and be
  caught by the plain Construct rule. So B1.3's lowering ordering (move-elide relative to
  var-buffer elide) is a real design knob — likely: run var-buffer elision first, then move-elide
  on the collapsed IR.

## B1.3 mechanism (investigated — the transfer primitive; the loft-codegen gate for the lowering)

Captured the ops the move rewrite must emit/drop, and found the one missing primitive:

- **The move IS an `adopt`** — write the source's `DbRef` into the destination slot; the source
  stops owning the store. The runtime already does this for **var slots**: `OpPutRef`
  (`fill.rs::put_ref` = `put_var(pos, dbref)`) and `bind_or_copy`'s OWNED arm (`mut_var = src`,
  io.rs:1624). This is the mechanism the var-buffer `ElidePlan` transfer uses.
- **But every field-write today COPIES** — `a.items = base` → `OpClearVector` + `OpAppendVector`
  into the field's *existing* store; `s.i = fresh` → `OpCopyRecord` into the existing field store.
  **No op writes a DbRef into a struct FIELD slot** (`OpPutRef` targets a var *position*, not a
  field offset). So the field cannot adopt a source store today.
- **`OpDatabase(a)` leaves `a.items` an (empty) vector store** that `OpAppendVector` fills — the
  placeholder. The move must **free-before-adopt** it (the #506 adopt-arm pattern), or construct
  `a` with the field left null and adopt into it.

**⇒ B1.3 needs a new `OpAdoptField(container, field_off, src, tp)` op** (interp `fill.rs` +
`state/io.rs`, native `generation/ops/`): free the container's current field store if distinct
from `src`, then write `src`'s `DbRef` into the field slot; `src` is no longer freed separately.
The rewrite then, for each `MovePlan`: (1) drop the field copy (`OpAppendVector(field, src)` /
`OpCopyRecord`); (2) emit `OpAdoptField(container, off, src, tp)`; (3) drop `OpFreeRef(src)` (the
store is now the field's, freed when the container is). The Record `v[i]=e` case adopts into an
*element* slot (`OpGetVector` target) rather than a field — likely a sibling `OpAdoptElem` or a
unified `OpAdopt(dest_ref, src)` taking any destination `DbRef`. **Cleanest: one `OpAdopt(dest, src)`
that takes the destination as a `DbRef` (from `OpGetField`/`OpGetVector`) — mirrors how the copy
ops already take their destination — so construction and record share one op.** Prove that op on a
hand-constructed `make_dead`/`rec_move` (value+leak+poison, both backends) BEFORE wiring the
rewrite (the loft-codegen gate).

## B1.3 CORRECTION (the gate caught it) — the representation splits the lowering in two

Attempting to build one `OpAdopt(dest, src)` surfaced a heap-safety fact that **reframes B1.3** —
recorded here because it is exactly the corruption the loft-codegen gate exists to prevent:

**`DATABASE.md`: `Vector(T)` is a BY-VALUE array — elements live INLINE in the vector's element
block** (`Array(T)` is the by-reference one). Consequences for the two `MovePlan` kinds:

- **Record `v[i] = e` (`vector<E>`, E a struct) — the element is INLINE.** `do_copy_record` copies
  `e`'s record *into* the inline slot (`store(&to).copy_block`). There is **no separate element
  store to adopt** — a DbRef-swap here would point the inline slot at foreign memory = corruption.
  The right lowering is **INLINE CONSTRUCTION**: build `e` DIRECTLY into `v[i]`'s inline slot (skip
  `e`'s own `OpDatabase` + the copy + the free), i.e. retarget `e`'s construction ops to the element
  slot — the var-buffer `elide_rewrite` pattern, no new op.
- **Construction `S { f: base }` where `f` is a `vector`/collection FIELD — the field holds a
  HANDLE** to a separate element block. THIS one adopts: swap `a.items`'s handle to `base`'s block,
  free the empty placeholder block, drop `base`'s free. An `OpAdopt`-style handle-write fits here.
- **`S { f: base }` where the source is BUILT IN PLACE** (a literal / append-built `base`) can
  ALSO be inlined (retarget `base`'s fill to `a.items`), often simpler than an adopt; **only a
  source whose store comes from a CALL** (`base = mk()`) genuinely needs the handle-adopt (its store
  can't be retargeted).

**⇒ Revised B1.3 shape:** the move-elision is **retarget-the-source-construction** (inline) as the
primary mechanism — it covers both the inline-element record case and the in-place-built
construction case, reuses the `elide_rewrite` machinery, and needs no new heap op. The
**handle-adopt** (`OpAdopt` on a collection-field handle) is the SECOND mechanism, needed only for a
**call-sourced** handle field. The `MovePlan` should therefore carry the source's **origin**
(in-place-built vs call-result) and the destination's **representation** (inline slot vs handle) so
B1.3 picks the correct lowering — a detection widening for B1.2b, before any lowering lands.

This is the gate working: the naive single-`OpAdopt` would have corrupted every `v[i] = e`
(inline-element) move. Do NOT implement a heap op until the inline-vs-handle case is proven per
destination (value + length + **leak + poison**, both backends) on a hand-constructed cell.

## B1.3 LANDED — the RECORD-shape inline-retarget rewrite (`move_elide`, both backends)

Built as a pure **IR rewrite** in `src/scopes.rs::move_elide` (mirrors `elide_borrows`), run in
`check` after borrow-elision, gated on `LOFT_MOVE_ELIDE`; **no new op** — so both backends lower
the retargeted `OpSet*` via existing support. Covers the **Record** `MovePlan` kind (`v[i] = e`,
`o.f = src`); the **Construct** kind is filtered out (deferred — needs a build-order reorder, see
below). Per dead-after source `s`:

```text
  OpDatabase(s)                          ── dropped
  OpSetInt (s, off, v)  ── retarget ──▶  OpSetInt (dest, off, v)   (dest = the OpCopyRecord target)
  OpSetText(s, off, v)  ── retarget ──▶  OpSetText(dest, off, v)
  OpCopyRecord(s, dest)                  ── dropped (the deep copy is gone)
  set_skip_free(s)                       ── the later variables() pass emits no scope-exit free
```

Two findings that the empirical matrix (value + poison + leak, both backends) settled — each had
been a theorised blocker:

- **The old-content-free is handled by `OpSet*` itself.** Retargeting `OpSetText(dest, …)` onto a
  slot that already holds a heap text (`v[0].name` = a 320-byte store) does **not** leak the old
  text — `OpSetText` frees the field's prior content when it overwrites. So the inline retarget
  needs no explicit `remove_claims(dest)`. (Proven: the 320-byte heap-text cell is leak-clean.)
- **The source free is inserted by a LATER pass**, not present when `move_elide` runs — so dropping
  `OpDatabase(s)` left a `variables()`-emitted `OpFreeRef(s)` on the now-null slot (a harmless
  free-of-null, but fragile). `set_skip_free(s)` suppresses it at the source of the fact.

**Validated (both backends, `LOFT_POISON=1` + `LOFT_NATIVE_LEAK_CHECK=1`):** element set,
field replacement (`o.inner = src`), two-moves-in-one-fn, nested-record source — all value-identical
+ leak-clean; the survivor (`e` read after the set) still COPIES; the Construct shape stays a copy.
Guards: `tests/use_analysis.rs::move_elide_record_*` (behavioural both-backend + IR off-vs-on copy
count). OFF is a no-op (early return) → suite byte-identical.

**Deferred to B1.3b — the Construct shape (`S { f: src }`).** Its source is built BEFORE the
container exists, so the retarget needs a build-order reorder (or the handle-adopt for a
call-sourced collection field). Filtered out of `move_elide` for now; detection still fires (the
`MOVE-PLAN … kind=Construct` dump), so B1.3b has its worklist.

### B1.3b design (grounded — `make_dead` capture, `a = Bag { items: base }`)

Current IR: `base`'s backing `__vdb_1` is `OpDatabase`'d + filled (`OpPreAllocVector(base)` +
element `OpNewRecord/OpFinishRecord`), THEN `a` is `OpDatabase`'d, THEN
`OpAppendVector(a.items, base)` **copies** base's block into `a.items`, then `OpFreeRef(__vdb_1)`.
Two things differ from the Record case:

1. **Reorder.** `base` is built before `a` exists. To retarget base's fill into `a.items`, `a`'s
   `OpDatabase` + items-init must move BEFORE base's construction.
2. **The retarget is over the vector-BUILD ops** (`OpPreAllocVector` / `OpNewRecord` /
   `OpFinishRecord` — the element append machinery), not the scalar `OpSet*` the Record case had.

**Two candidate lowerings, ranked:**
- **(A, recommended) reorder-inline retarget** — hoist `a`'s alloc above base's fill, retarget
  `OpPreAllocVector(base)`+element-ops onto `a.items`, drop `__vdb_1` + its free + the
  `OpAppendVector` copy. **Reuses the retarget idiom (extended to the vector-build ops), no new heap
  op, no handle-representation risk** — same safety envelope as the landed Record rewrite. Cost: the
  reorder mutation (move a's alloc-block earlier) and matching a wider op set.
- **(B) handle-adopt** — swap `a.items`'s handle to `__vdb_1`'s element block, free a's empty items
  placeholder, drop the `__vdb_1` free. More surgical but needs a **handle-write primitive** AND a
  proven model of how a `vector<T>` FIELD references its block (inline-length vs separate handle) —
  the representation the gate insists on proving on a hand-built poison cell before any heap op.

**Plan:** do (A) — extend `move_rewrite` to (i) recognise the Construct `MovePlan`, (ii) hoist the
container's alloc block, (iii) retarget the source's `OpPreAllocVector`/element-build ops onto the
field, (iv) drop the wrapper alloc/copy/free + `set_skip_free`. Matrix the same grid (value + poison
+ leak, both backends) on `make_dead`/`keep_alive`. Reserve (B) only for a **call-sourced** field
(`items: mk()`) where there is no in-place fill to retarget — and prove the field representation
first. Also fold the `a.items = base` whole-replacement (chained through `__p154_rhs`) here.

### B1.3b LANDED — the REORDER-FREE field-append (`x.field += src`, both backends)

Built as `src/scopes.rs::construct_move_rewrite` (a sibling of the Record rewrite). It splits the
Construct kind by the one axis that makes (A) safe WITHOUT a reorder: **does the destination
container already exist when `src` is built?**

- **Reorder-free (`x.field += src`, container is a param OR built before `src`)** — the case
  handled. `src` is a view over its backing wrapper `vdb` (`src = OpGetField(vdb, …)`); retarget
  `src`'s element builds (`OpNewRecord`/`OpFinishRecord`) directly onto `x.field` (= the
  `OpAppendVector` destination), and drop `vdb`'s alloc/len-init/free, `src`'s view-def, `src`'s
  capacity `OpPreAllocVector` (omitted — `x.field` already exists; retargeting it would reset the
  length), and the `OpAppendVector` copy. `set_skip_free(vdb)` (the wrapper is the owned store;
  `src` is its borrow). **No new op** — the retargeted `OpNewRecord` grows `x.field` exactly as the
  copy's `vector_add` did (proven: value + poison + leak clean, both backends).
- **Fresh construction (`a = Bag { items: base }`, container built AFTER the source)** — still a
  COPY. **The reorder guard** (`construct_move_rewrite`: the container's `OpDatabase` must precede
  the source-backing's, tracked by encounter order; a param has none → always before) SKIPS it, so
  it never fires unsafely. This is the residual for B1.3c (needs the build-order reorder, whose
  hazards — a's alloc and the copy share one construction Insert; other fields may depend on the
  source — are why it is split off).

**Validated (both backends, `LOFT_POISON=1` + `LOFT_NATIVE_LEAK_CHECK=1`):** local-container append,
param-container append, two-appends-in-one-fn — all value-identical + leak-clean; the survivor still
copies; fresh construction stays a copy (guard fires). Guards:
`tests/use_analysis.rs::move_elide_construct_*`. OFF byte-identical (early return).

**Why the reorder-free split (not the full reorder) first:** the reorder-free case is a pure
retarget (the Record machinery, extended to the vector-build ops) — representation-safe, no code
motion. It captures the field-append subset of Construct now; the fresh-construction reorder (B1.3c)
is a distinct, higher-risk slice deferred behind the guard, exactly per the "prove the safe path,
gate the rest" discipline that caught the `OpAdopt` corruption.

### B1.3c LANDED — the FRESH-construction reorder (`a = Bag { items: base }`, both backends)

Built as `src/scopes.rs::construct_fresh_rewrite`, run AFTER B1.3b on the copies it left standing.
The structure dump settled the mechanism: **make_dead's function body is a FLAT top-level block** (a's
alloc and base's build are siblings in one operator vec), and **a's construction is a contiguous run
of statements immediately before the copy**. So the reorder is a flat-vec rebuild, not a nested-Insert
split:

```text
  [base build → __vdb_1] … [a alloc+init] [OpAppendVector(a.items, base)]   (before)
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  [a alloc+init] [base build → RETARGETED onto a.items, __vdb_1 dropped] …  (after)
```

Retarget `base`'s build ops (`OpPreAllocVector`/`OpNewRecord`/`OpFinishRecord`) onto `a.items`;
here `OpPreAllocVector` IS retargeted (the fresh field is empty, so pre-claiming its capacity is
correct — the field-append case dropped it because the field was non-empty). Drop the wrapper
(`__vdb_1`) alloc/len-init + `base`'s view-def + the copy; `set_skip_free(__vdb_1)`.

**Conservative guards (fire only when ALL hold — else stays a copy, safe under flip):** flat
top-level block; exactly ONE still-copying construct source in the function; `a`'s construction is a
contiguous run right before the copy that references **only `a`** (dependency-safe to hoist past
`base`'s build — a param/computed field value like `Bag { id: n, items: base }` references another
var → SKIP); the run contains `a`'s `OpDatabase`; and `a` is allocated AFTER the source backing (a
real reorder). Validated (both backends, poison + leak): `make_dead`, single-literal-field fresh
construct → elide; survivor, param-field-value, and two-fresh-constructs-in-one-fn → correctly stay
copies. Guards: `tests/use_analysis.rs::move_elide_fresh_*` +
`move_elide_construct_elides_field_append_and_fresh_construction`.

**Residual widenings (future, all SAFE-skipped today):** param/computed field values (allow run vars
that are parameters — they exist at entry, so hoisting is safe); >1 fresh construct per function;
nested-Insert (non-flat) bodies. Each is a guard relaxation, not a new mechanism.

### B1.4 LANDED — param field values in the hoisted run (the interprocedural soundness line)

The B1.3c run guard was "references ONLY `a`" — which skipped the common `Bag { id: n, items: base }`
(a param field value). B1.4 relaxes it to **`a` or a never-written parameter**: a param's value is
constant, so hoisting `a`'s construction past `base`'s build reads the same value.

**The soundness line — and the trap the review caught.** "Never written" MUST be interprocedural.
loft's `&`-param passes a param by reference (`add(100, n)` where `add(x, y: &integer)` mutates the
caller's `n`), and the param can sit in ANY argument position — so a naive "Set-target or Call
first-arg" write-scan MISSES an arg1 `&`-mutation and would hoist a stale read (a wrong VALUE, not
just a missed optimisation). The fix reuses `parser::find_written_vars` (the existing
interprocedural mutation analysis, aware of callee `&`-param signatures) computed in `move_elide`
and threaded into `construct_fresh_rewrite`; a run var is allowed iff `is_argument(v) &&
!written.contains(v)`.

**Validated (both backends, poison + leak):** `Bag { id: n, items: base }` with `n` never written →
elides; `n` reassigned (`n = n*10`), and `n` mutated via a callee's arg1 `&`-param (`add(100, n)`) →
correctly stay copies (a wrong hoist would have surfaced as a stale value, e.g. `6` instead of
`106`). Guards: `tests/use_analysis.rs::move_elide_param_field_widening_is_sound`.

## Verifiable slices (each: matrix on BOTH backends, gated behind a flag, suite byte-identical off)

- **B1.1 — gate (DONE for interp).** The capture above is the spec; add the native target Rust
  beside it. Prove the WORKING move by hand-writing/patching one case and running it value+leak
  clean on both backends before touching the generator.
- **B1.2 — the plan.** `MovePlan { field-target, source-var, container }` produced in the post-parse
  pass from the survival `move` classification (source = a dead named var; NOT a param; NOT
  mutated-after; NOT in a loop where the source outlives the body). Gate on `LOFT_MOVE_ELIDE`
  (default off). No lowering yet → suite byte-identical; dump the plan to prove detection matches
  the survey's `move` rows exactly (positive control: fires on `make_dead`, silent on `keep_alive`).
- **B1.3 — RECORD-shape lowering (DONE, both backends).** `move_elide` retargets the source's
  construction ops onto the copy destination + drops the alloc/copy/free (`set_skip_free`). Landed
  as ONE IR pass (no new op) → interp AND native from the same rewrite; the B1.4 native split is
  therefore unnecessary for this shape. Matrix-validated (value + poison + leak). See "B1.3 LANDED".
- **B1.3b — CONSTRUCT field-append (DONE, both backends).** `x.field += src` where the container
  already exists: `construct_move_rewrite` retargets `src`'s element builds onto `x.field` + drops
  the wrapper/copy/prealloc/free, guarded reorder-free (container's `OpDatabase` precedes the
  source-backing's, or the container is a param). No new op. See "B1.3b LANDED".
- **B1.3c — CONSTRUCT fresh construction (DONE, both backends).** `a = Bag { items: base }`,
  container built after the source. `construct_fresh_rewrite` does the build-order reorder on a flat
  block (a's construction is a contiguous run right before the copy — hoist it, retarget base's build
  onto a.field, drop the wrapper/copy). Conservatively guarded (flat block, one construct, run refs
  only `a`, real reorder); everything else stays a copy. No new op. See "B1.3c LANDED".
- **B1.4 — param field values + multiple constructs (DONE).** (a) Allow a never-written parameter
  as a hoisted run value, soundness on the interprocedural `find_written_vars` (catches `&`-param
  mutation in any arg position). (b) Lift the one-construct-per-fn cap: `construct_fresh_rewrite`
  loops, rewriting each safe construct by earliest remaining copy (re-scan after each; a failed
  source is recorded for termination) — a cross-construct dependency is a non-`a`/non-param run var,
  so it self-SKIPs. See "B1.4 LANDED". Remaining (SAFE-skipped, each a NEW sub-slice not a guard
  relaxation): nested-Insert (non-flat) bodies; the `a.items = base` whole-replacement — a DOUBLE
  copy through `__p154_rhs` (`base → __p154_rhs → a.items`, with an `OpClearVector`), not detected
  today, needing new detection + a move-the-clear reorder (B1.3d).
- **B1.5 — graduate + flip.** Guards landed in `tests/use_analysis.rs` (record + construct + fresh +
  param); extend to `tests/scripts/` + `tests/leak_cases/`, then flip `LOFT_MOVE_ELIDE` default-on
  with a `LOFT_NO_MOVE_ELIDE` opt-out (run the full suite flag-ON first). Re-run the survey — the
  `move` rows show **0** runtime copies.

## Falsification probes (cheapest thing that could break each load-bearing claim)

1. *Claim: the source-free folds into the container's free (no leak, no double-free).* Probe: the
   DEAD construction cell under `LOFT_POISON=1` + `LOFT_STORES=warn` — must be clean. If it
   double-frees, site (3) suppression is wrong; if it leaks, the field didn't adopt the store.
2. *Claim: a survivor is untouched.* Probe: `keep_alive` (base read after) must STILL emit the
   copy (`LOFT_COPY_DUMP` shows the append) — value-identical to today. A silent 0-copy here = C86
   broken.
3. *Claim: the decision is the phase-A `move` fact, not a new re-derivation.* Probe: the B1.2 plan
   dump must be exactly the survival split's `bucket=implicit [move: source consumed]` rows — no
   more, no fewer. A divergence means phase B re-derived (the wrong chokepoint).
4. *Claim: value-identity across backends.* Probe: the differential oracle (`tests/oracle/`) over
   the matrix — interp and native must agree on stdout/exit/leak for every cell.

## Do-not-ship (revert, don't push through)

Any DEAD cell double-frees/leaks (F1/F2); a SURVIVES/MUTATED cell elides (F3, C86 broken); one
backend moves and the other copies (F4); the plan diverges from the survival `move` rows (re-derivation).

## Why this is safe to build on (per the "do the complexity now" rule)

The move-elision is the store-lifetime engine's **positive** direction (transfer a store INTO a
container), the mirror of @PLN85 P4's borrow-return (borrow a field OUT —
[borrow-return/DESIGN.md](borrow-return/DESIGN.md)). Landing it makes the survival `move` fact
*load-bearing* (not just diagnostic), which is the foundation the rest of phase B / the C86 elision
completeness builds on — and it retires a real, measured cost (every dead-source construction /
record set currently copies-then-frees).
