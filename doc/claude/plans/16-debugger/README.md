## Status

In progress — **tracer-bullet slice landed (2026-06-08)**: the riskiest unknown is
now proven *yes*. A breakpoint set on a source line pauses the interpreter there and
reads the live frame's arguments correctly; it fires once per call and is inert when
nothing is registered. `src/debugger.rs` (`Debugger`/`BreakHit`) + the per-op hook
in `State::execute_argv` + `set_breakpoint_fn_line` (function-scoped) /
`set_breakpoint_fn_entry` / `capture_break_frame` / `render_frame_local`;
`tests/debugger.rs` (**17 tests**). **The pipeline works end-to-end:** set a
breakpoint → pause + capture the live frame (args **and** non-arg locals,
liveness-gated, every value type) → **drop into a REPL and evaluate against the
frame** (`ReplSession::seed_frame` / `from_parser` — `n + a == 21`,
`pt.x * pt.y == 12`) → **conditional breakpoints** (`frame_holds`) → **step
into / over / out / continue** (`debug_step`) → **suspend, edit a value in the REPL,
resume — and execution continues with the edited value** (`enable_stepping` /
`set_frame_value` / `value_of`: edit `n` at a break → `calc(5)` returns 990).
D0 + D1 + E + F done. The hot loop carries one
`Option::is_some` branch per op when not debugging (issues suite green — no
regression). **Facts the slices pinned** (matrix-first paid off): a function-*entry*
breakpoint pauses pre-prologue (slots zero), so the read point is a **body line**; a
variable sits at the frame-absolute `stack_cur.pos + args_base + vars.stack(i)` —
*not* `get_var`'s stack-depth-relative operand; a bare line number is *unscoped*
(matches every function), so breakpoints are function-scoped; `first_def`/`last_use`
are *sequence* numbers (wrong unit), but `self.vars`' `code_pos → var_nr` map yields
a usable reference-range liveness (Q6); the **own-format literal is the D1 bridge**
(so read-eval-at-frame needs no @PLN14 store-resident env — exact value-for-value
seeding is the remaining upgrade); and **loft calls are *jumps*** (all execution
state is in `State` fields), so the loop can suspend at a breakpoint and re-enter to
resume — the basis for F's step into/over/out + edit-and-continue. **G1 interactive
pause/step/edit + REPL-at-frame landed (2026-06-08)**: the REPL itself now suspends
at a breakpoint (`(dbg)` prompt), shows the frame, steps (into/over/out/continue),
edits a live **scalar** local (integer/float/single/boolean/character, by literal
or expression) that the resumed call picks up, **and evaluates any expression
against the paused frame** (`n * 3`, `pt.x * pt.y` — every type) — all proven
end-to-end through the binary. **G1-span fixed (2026-06-08):** breakpoints now
resolve against the dense `line_numbers` table, so **every** body line is breakable
(was source-spans = fault-prone arithmetic only, leaving pure-`if`/constant bodies
unbreakable). **B finished (2026-06-09):** B1 (interpret_set) + B2 (`unmark_for_debug`
— un-mark + recompile switches a compiled fn's interpret-set back to interpreted) +
B3-introspection (`break_stack`) shipped; the B3 *switching* facet (on-demand
mid-run, on-stack deopt) deferred to the lavition engine integration. **Text +
simple-enum live edits landed (2026-06-09):** a text **local** (owned `String`,
overwritten without dropping the possibly-uninitialised prior slot) and text
**argument** (16-byte `Str` repointed at a `Debugger`-owned buffer) and a simple
enum (inline discriminant byte) are now editable at a pause and picked up on resume;
the fix also corrected the text-**local** *read* (the renderer was reading every text
slot as a 16-byte `Str`, but a non-arg local is a 24-byte `String` — showed `""`).
**Scalar struct-field edits landed (2026-06-09):** `pt.x = 9` at the `(dbg)` prompt
resolves the struct local's `DbRef`, looks the field offset up in the schema, and
writes the scalar in place (`State::set_frame_field`; `debug_set` routes a dotted
LHS) — the first heap-value edit, correct by construction (no allocation).
**Vector-element edits landed (2026-06-09):** `v[1] = 9` at the `(dbg)` prompt resolves
the element type / stride from the vector type and writes the scalar at `8 + i·stride`
(`State::set_frame_element`, mirroring the interpreter's own element access; `debug_set`
routes a `[` LHS), verified end-to-end (the resumed program reads the edited element).
The **store change journal** ([STORE_JOURNAL.md](STORE_JOURNAL.md)) is built through
its core: the two-file binary model (index store + blob file), `Modify`/`Insert`/`Free`
record + `apply`/`revert`, the keystone **`claim_at`** (exact-position re-materialisation,
fuzz-verified — probe #6, 12 seeds × 600 ops), and the **recording layer** (per-`Store`
change buffer → `Stores::take_journal` drains to one journal, one cold-path branch when
off). **Whole-value heap edits landed (2026-06-09):** `pt = Point{…}` (and vectors,
struct-enums, structs with a text field) now replace a heap local at a pause. The
mechanism is **store-level adoption**, *not* the journal's record-`Insert` replay the
design first sketched — because construction allocates a **whole new store per value**
(`database_named`), which the per-store recording never captures (a store born after
`start_recording` has `recording: None`) and which `State::new` cannot build over a
clone-of-live (it forces the stack / `CONST_STORE` to slots 0/1). Instead: `debug_eval`
resolves the RHS against the frame to a self-contained own-format literal;
`materialize_heap_value` builds that literal on a **throwaway `State`** whose store
high-water is raised above the live store's (`Stores::raise_floor`), so every value-store
lands on a slot **free in live**; those whole stores are grafted into the paused State at
their coinciding slots (`Stores::adopt_value_stores`) with **no `DbRef` remap** (root +
internal graph keep their slot numbers), and the frame slot is repointed
(`State::set_frame_dbref`). The suspended frame is never touched (separate State, separate
stack). The `claim_at`/journal substrate stays for the in-place edits, **undo**, and the
relocating-grow. **Undo/redo landed (2026-06-09, M2):** every interactive edit records
a per-edit `Journal` of the region(s) it overwrites; `:undo`/`:redo` revert/replay it,
a fresh edit forks the timeline, and the history is per-pause-point (cleared on resume).
**File-run debugger landed (2026-06-09, M5a):** `loft debug <file>:<line>` breaks in a
real `.loft` file and drops into the same interactive `(dbg)` prompt — the A–F engine
is no longer REPL-only. **Watchpoints landed (2026-06-09, M3):** `:watch pt.x` /
`:watch v[i]` — a resumed run pauses (reporting old → new) when a later write changes
the watched scalar heap region; the per-op poll lives in the resume loop, only active
while debugging. **Rich breakpoints landed (2026-06-09, M5d phase 1):** conditional
breakpoints (`:break f if c.n < 0` — break only when a predicate over the frame holds,
reusing E in a driver-side resolve loop) + **tracepoints** (`:trace f x, y` — log the
expressions on each hit and continue, no pause). Both catch "fails on one call in
10 000". The unified `BreakSpec` (location + condition + actions + stop) is the unit the
wire protocol's `setBreakpoints` carries. **`--rpc` debug server landed (2026-06-09, M5d
phase 2):** `loft debug --rpc` — the NDJSON stdio driver over the engine (`src/rpc.rs`),
a thin serialiser over `ReplSession` speaking the [wire protocol](PROTOCOL.md); requests
parse via loft's inbuilt JSON, `eval` values serialise via `.to_json()`, program output
streams as `output` events. The *agent* surface is real (`tests/rpc.rs` drives a full
session over a pipe). **Next**: the **`--serve` WebSocket + browser** (M5b/M5e) — the
editor + run/test buttons + suite runner + debugger + compiler/program console IDE,
reusing the viewer shell over the same protocol.

This is the **purpose the REPL work serves**: the REPL is not standalone
dev-tooling, it is the *interactive surface of a breakpoint debugger*. The plan
composes three things loft already has or is building rather than building a
debugger from scratch:

- the **interpreter**, which can already step op-by-op and *suspend a frame* (the
  coroutine `yield` machinery snapshots the live stack frame);
- the **per-function interpret-over-a-compiled-baseline dispatch** (N9/C71
  shared-store dispatch + Goal-D backend parity) — the mechanism that flips one
  routine to the interpreter while the rest stays compiled;
- the **store-resident session environment** (@PLN14) — which, seeded from a paused
  frame instead of from typed bindings, *is* the breakpoint's variable view.

A breakpoint is then: *suspend the interpreter at a source line, expose the paused
frame as a REPL environment.* Everything new is the glue around that.

**Host-agnostic engine, multiple surfaces.** The debug *engine* (sub-arcs A–F) has
no UI and no browser dependency — it is a loft API: set/clear breakpoints, run,
pause, read/mutate the frame, evaluate against it, step, resume. It runs anywhere
loft runs:

- **terminal / CLI** — the **shipped REPL is the headless surface**: hit a
  breakpoint, drop into the terminal REPL at that frame. Nearly free — it is the
  REPL pointed at a paused frame instead of stdin.
- **browser** — its *natural home*: a DAP adapter + web UI (gutter breakpoints,
  variables panel, call stack, REPL console) make it rich and visual.
- **embedded** — a game's own console (the lavition "live interface" node) drives
  the same API in-process.

The browser is where it gets the best ergonomics; it is **not** where it lives. The
engine ships and is useful from a terminal before any browser UI exists.

## Goal

Set a breakpoint in a routine; loft flips that routine **and its live call-chain**
to the interpreter, pauses when the line is reached, and drops into a REPL whose
environment is the **paused frame's locals** — inspect and change live state,
evaluate against the frame, optionally break only when a condition/assertion fires,
then step or resume — driven by a **host-agnostic debug API** that a terminal, the
browser (its natural home), or an embedded console all consume, with the rest of the
program still running compiled.

## Effort + design

- **Effort:** VH — multi-phase execution-control + API + (per-surface) protocol/UI;
  spans the interpreter, the dispatch boundary, @PLN14's env, and a DAP surface.
- **Design:** — needs design (this README is the first cut); each sub-arc earns its
  own design doc as it unpauses.
- **Last touched:** 2026-06-09

## Why this isn't a bolt-on subsystem

The naive debugger is a second execution engine with its own frame model — the
brittle path. loft's is the *composition* above: the invariant is **one frame
model, one environment model, shared by the REPL session and the breakpoint
frame.** A paused frame's locals and a REPL session's bindings are the same
store-resident records (position-independent `DbRef`s); a conditional breakpoint is
just `eval` against that env. Hold that invariant and the debugger is a suspend
hook + a registry + a seed bridge; lose it and it's a parallel interpreter.

## Prior art — this is HotSpot's deoptimization model

The architecture matches how the JVM debugs (HotSpot + JDWP/JVMTI) almost
feature-for-feature — strong validation that the model is sound, not accidental.
The core identity is the same: a **mixed interpreter + compiled runtime where
debugging works by forcing the debugged code back into the interpreter**, because
the interpreter is the only mode with breakpoint hooks and introspectable frames.

| loft | Java / HotSpot |
|---|---|
| interpreted bytecode + compiled cdylib baseline (Goal-D parity) | interpreter + C1/C2 JIT (deopt preserves semantics) |
| **B/B2** — switch a fn to the interpreter to break in it | JVMTI `interp_only` / deoptimization |
| breakpoint = a check in the interpreter loop | JIT code has no hooks; the interpreter does |
| **`break_stack`** — frames + per-frame locals | JDI `StackFrame` + `visibleVariables` |
| **liveness reference-range** (`first_ref ≤ pc ≤ last_ref`) | LocalVariableTable scope start/length (`-g`) |
| **`set_frame_value`** → resume | `StackFrame.setValue` → continue |
| **`debug_step`** (line + call-depth) | JDWP step requests (INTO/OVER/OUT) |
| **`frame_holds`** — eval a condition against the frame | conditional breakpoints (JDI expression eval) |
| edit-and-continue / live editing (lavition) | HotSwap (`RedefineClasses`) |
| shared store across interpreted + compiled | unified heap shared by interpreter + JIT |

**The one capability loft is behind:** HotSpot can **deoptimize a frame already
running compiled, *on the stack*** — it reconstructs interpreter frames for live
JIT frames from debug metadata the JIT emits at safepoints (scope descriptors
mapping registers/stack slots to interpreter locals), so it can introspect and
step *out* through a caller that ran JIT-compiled.  loft today can only switch at
the **call boundary** — interpret a function from its *entry* (B2 re-wires before
it runs), never catch one mid-flight: a cdylib frame's locals live in native
registers with no safepoint metadata to reconstruct them.  The shared store gives
the *data* for free; what's missing is the *control-state* mapping mid-cdylib.
**This is exactly the B3-switching limitation** (and the "indirect caller already
compiled is non-introspectable" gap).

**Why loft's domain rarely needs on-stack deopt: the main loop provides re-entry.**
lavition runs a Rust main loop that calls into loft each frame, so a function is
**re-entered every iteration**.  Set a breakpoint → re-wire that function to
interpret → *resume*: the current (possibly compiled) frame finishes
un-introspected, and the **next loop iteration enters the interpreted path** and
breaks there.  You never reconstruct the live compiled frame — the loop hands you a
fresh interpreted entry ~one frame later.  This is precisely why HotSpot *needs*
on-stack deopt (the JVM can't assume a method runs again) and loft's frame-loop
domain doesn't: re-entry is free.  Edges: it assumes the program **loops** (a
one-shot batch run re-runs instead — cheap via state continuity); the next iteration
is the **evolved** state, not the exact frame (use a conditional breakpoint (E) to
catch a specific invocation); and a within-iteration step-out into an
already-compiled caller still waits one cycle.

**KNOWN — deferred, not dismissed (Q7).** True on-stack deopt — introspecting a
frame *mid-flight* without re-entry (a non-looping program, the *exact* current
invocation, step-out into a compiled caller *now*) — remains a real, unsolved
capability the loop only side-steps.  We may revisit it to get the general case
fully correct; it is tricky (needs cdylib-side safepoint metadata to reconstruct
interpreter locals from native registers — the hard part HotSpot pays for).

## Composition matrix — Stage A

The load-bearing claim: *a breakpoint pauses with the correct frame, and evaluating
/ mutating in the REPL-at-frame is faithful to the live program.* Probe before
building, on `--interpret`, **driving the engine API directly (no UI)**:

- **breakpoint site** — fn entry · mid-fn line · inside a loop body · inside a
  branch not taken (never fires) · last line before return.
- **frame contents** — locals of every type (scalars, text, struct, vector, enum,
  nested) visible + correctly typed in the REPL-at-frame; an unassigned-yet local
  (before its first write) reported as such, not garbage.
- **call-chain** — break N frames deep: the stack above is introspectable (each
  caller's locals + args), step-out lands in the caller's frame.
- **interpret scope** — a breakpoint reachable only through compiled callers still
  fires (the chain switched to interpret); a function with no path to any
  breakpoint stays compiled (no blanket slowdown).
- **condition / test** — a condition referencing frame locals breaks only when true;
  an assertion-style breakpoint fires on violation; a condition with a side effect
  runs once per hit, not per step.
- **mutate + resume** — change a local in the REPL-at-frame, resume, observe the
  program continue with the new value.
- **backend parity** — the *value* observed at a break equals what `--native` would
  compute for the same point (Goal-D parity is what makes interpret-on-break
  invisible).

Done when every cell is green from the **headless API** (so every surface inherits
it) and the probes graduate to a debugger regression suite.

## Sub-arcs

The host-agnostic engine is A–F; the surfaces are G.

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| **A** — breakpoint registry + source-line → bytecode-offset map (reuse the per-op source positions the bytecode already carries) | **First cut** — **function-scoped** line breakpoints (`set_breakpoint_fn_line`, scoped to `[code_position, +code_length)` — a bare line matches that line in *every* function, stdlib included) + fn-entry, via `source_spans` / `code_position` |
| **B** — interpret-scope analysis: from a breakpoint set, compute the functions whose call-chain must interpret (static call-graph reachability; refine to on-demand frame-entry switching) | **B1 done** — `interpret_set(data, bp_fn)` = the bp fn + its **transitive callers**, a fixpoint over the static call graph. The graph comes from `collect_calls`, an **exhaustive** walk of all 34 `Value` variants (no `_` wildcard, so a new IR construct is a compile error, never a silently-dropped call edge — the under-reach hazard). Pure, no execution. **Limitation (verified):** `CallRef` (fn-ref / indirect calls) is unresolvable statically — `breakpoint_fires_in_indirectly_called_fn` proves the breakpoint still *fires* through a fn-ref (execution is fine), while `b1_does_not_trace_indirect_callers` proves the indirect caller is *absent* from the static `interpret_set`. So an interpreted middle reached via a fn-ref over compiled-deeper functions works at the *execution* layer; only static auto-discovery of its caller-chain fails — which is exactly what **B3 (on-demand, runtime-path-driven)** resolves. **B3 introspection facet done** — `break_stack(data)` walks the **live `call_stack`** and captures every frame, so the full chain to the break is introspectable *including indirectly-reached callers*: `b3_full_stack_includes_indirect_caller` shows the fn-ref caller `apply` appears with its locals (`x==5`), the very frame B1 could not link — the runtime path resolves the static gap. **B2 done** — `unmark_for_debug(data, bp_fn)` clears the default-native mark (`def.native`) on every **body-bearing** fn in `interpret_set(bp_fn)`, so the standard recompile routes their calls to the **interpreted** body. **Mechanism correction:** the compiled-vs-interpret choice is *codegen-time*, keyed on the callee's `def.native` (`codegen.rs:2542` — set → `OpStaticCall` cdylib bridge; empty + a user body → `OpCall` interpreted), so the switch is **un-mark + recompile**, **not** the `replace_static_fn` library swap the original note named — a library dispatcher (`fn(&mut Stores, &mut DbRef)`) has no `State`, so it cannot re-enter the interpreter to run a body.  *Body-bearing only:* a pure-cdylib fn (`code == Null`) stays marked — an absolute boundary.  Tests: `b2_unmark_switches_interpret_set_to_interpreted` (un-marks the bp fn + transitive callers, leaves an unreachable fn compiled, idempotent), `b2_pure_cdylib_fn_stays_an_absolute_boundary`.  **B2 is the engine-facing API** (the per-fn interpret engine calls it before recompiling a debug run); the all-interpreted REPL needs no wiring (user fns are already unmarked — no-op).  Full mixed-execution validation (a dispatched fn actually re-interpreting end-to-end) rides with the engine integration — same trigger as the switching facet below; the forward direction (marked → dispatch) is already proven by `tests/n2_cdylib.rs::f3_body_bearing_marked_fn_dispatch_vs_interpret`. **DEFERRED — B3 switching facet** (compiled→interpret *on-demand, mid-run*): needs a real mixed-execution scenario (cdylib loaded) + on-stack deopt for a frame *already* running compiled (Q7).  The main-loop re-entry side-steps it for lavition's frame-loop domain (re-wire → resume → next iteration enters the interpreted path); trigger = the lavition engine integration. |
| **C** — suspend hook: the bytecode loop pauses at a breakpoint offset and exposes the live frame (reuse the coroutine frame-snapshot machinery) | **First cut** — synchronous in-loop hook (record-and-continue); true suspend/resume for stepping is the enhancement |
| **D0** — frame read: capture the paused frame's variables (name → rendered value) from its slot table | **DONE** — captures **arguments + non-arg locals**, every value type (scalars/text inline, heap struct/vector/struct-enum via `show_loft`, simple enums by discriminant), via `render_frame_local`. Locals are **liveness-gated** by reference-range (`first_ref <= pc <= last_ref`) derived from `self.vars` (the codegen `code_pos → var_nr` map) — *safe* (a var in its read-range is necessarily assigned, never garbage) and it picks the right owner of a reused slot; the only gap is a defined-but-not-yet-read local before its first read (under-shows, never wrong). See Open question 6 (resolved). |
| **D1** — frame → REPL bridge: seed a `ReplSession` from D0's captured frame, so evaluating at a break runs against the live locals | **First cut (the headline, working)** — `ReplSession::seed_frame` binds each captured `(name, own-format literal)` as `name = <literal>`; `ReplSession::from_parser` builds the session over the program's parser so heap values' types are in scope. Eval-at-frame works end-to-end (`n + a == 21`, `pt.x * pt.y == 12`). **No @PLN14 dependency for read-eval** — the own-format literal *is* the bridge; exact value-for-value seeding + **frame mutation / write-back** (edit a local at the break, resume with it) is the @PLN14 upgrade. |
| **D2** — *live-frame* eval (the D1 upgrade): evaluate against the paused frame's **live bindings**, not a reconstruction of it from rendered own-format literals | **LANDED (2026-06-09) — first cut: bare heap locals.** D1 re-seeds a *new* session from each local's rendered literal and runs the expression on a **clone** of the paused state — fine for scalars / field-access, but a synthetic fn that **returns** a *bare heap value* faults when its fn-return deep-copy targets a store the clone never allocated (`allocation.rs` OOB — a member of the store-lifetime family, [#248](https://github.com/loft-lang/loft/issues/248)), so `eval pool` (a `vector`) yielded null. **Fix:** `State::eval_frame_heap` — a bare local holding a heap value (struct / vector / collection) is read **live, in place**: `show_json` (wire) / `show_loft` (REPL) renders its actual `DbRef` from the paused store. No reconstruct, no clone, no fn-return copy — so a bare `vector` renders (`[10,20,30]`), and the read shows what is *actually* in the store, never a copy of it (load-bearing for a consumer hunting store-lifetime bugs, where a *copy* can drop / desync a field). **Liveness-gated** like D0 (an un-live slot holds garbage, so reading its `DbRef` would re-introduce the OOB) → an un-live name falls through to a clean `None`. `debug_eval` (REPL) and `debug_eval_json` (`--rpc`) both try it first; computed expressions still take the reconstruct path (scalars + struct-via-`.to_json()`). Tests: `tests/rpc.rs::rpc_eval_bare_vector_live`, `tests/repl_session.rs::repl_interactive_eval_bare_heap_live`. **Follow-up (not yet):** a *heap field path* (`eval s.fi_q` where `fi_q` is a vector field) is not a bare ident, so it still routes through the reconstruct path → null for a vector field; **`eval s` shows the containing struct with every field** (incl. `fi_q`), so inspection is covered meanwhile. Extending the live read down a field/index path is the next increment. |
| **E** — conditional / test breakpoints: an expression/assertion evaluated in the frame env decides whether to break | **First cut** — `ReplSession::frame_holds(hit, condition)` seeds the frame (D1) and `assert`s the condition; a caller keeps only the hits where it holds (break when `n > 1`) or where an invariant is violated. Post-run filter on recorded hits; an in-loop *skip* (a non-matching breakpoint never even pauses) needs the condition pre-compiled against the frame — a refinement. |
| **F** — stepping + resume verbs (step over / into / out, continue) driving the bytecode loop — exposed as the **host-agnostic debug API** that all surfaces call | **DONE (first cut) — incl. edit-and-continue (the hard part)**. `enable_stepping` makes a breakpoint *suspend* (the execute loop returns to the driver, mirroring `frame_yield`, with the frame in `paused_frame`). `debug_step(StepMode)` resumes with **into / over / out / continue** by tracking the **source line** + **call depth** per op (*into* = next line at any depth; *over* = run a deeper call to completion, stop at the next line in the same/shallower frame; *out* = run to the frame's return). `set_frame_value` writes an edited value into the **live** frame slot; `resume` / `debug_step` then **picks it up**. Proven: edit `n` at a break → `calc(5)` returns 990; step *into* `inner`, *over* the call (result live), *out* to the caller. Works because loft calls are *jumps* (all execution state is in `State` fields, so the loop is freely re-enterable). `ReplSession::value_of` extracts the edited value (also the result-as-String primitive REPL.T deferred). |
| **G1** — terminal / CLI surface: drop into the **shipped REPL** at a paused frame (the near-free headless front-end) | **Interactive pause/step/edit landed** — the REPL `:break` command (**function-scoped**: `<fn>` body start via `State::set_breakpoint_fn_start`, or `<fn>:<line>`; `:break` lists / `clear` removes) and the **paused sub-mode**: when interactive stepping is on (the REPL driver enables it), the next call that reaches a breakpoint **suspends** — the live `State` is held on the session (`ReplSession::paused`), the prompt becomes `(dbg)`, and the frame is shown. At the pause: `:step`/`:next`/`:finish`/`:continue` (→ `debug_step`/`StepMode`), `name = <int>` edits the live frame (`debug_set` → `set_frame_value` + `refresh_paused_frame`), `:vars` re-shows it. On `:continue` to completion the observing statement prints its (edited) value. **The pause is a full REPL-at-frame:** any expression typed at `(dbg)` is evaluated against the live frame (`ReplSession::debug_eval` — swaps the session body to the frame's literal bindings and runs `value_of`, so it covers every type: `n * 3`, `pt.x * pt.y`, struct/vector reads), reusing the D1 bridge. New `Eval::Paused`; `ReplSession::debug_stepping/is_debugging/paused_frame/debug_set/debug_step/debug_continue/debug_eval/abort_debug`; `handle_paused` in `process_line` (wrapped in `catch_unwind` — a panic in the paused run abandons the debug session, never kills the REPL). Proven end-to-end through the binary (`tests/repl.rs::interactive_breakpoint_edit_continue` → `990`; `interactive_breakpoint_eval_expression`: `n * 3` → `15`) plus `tests/repl_session.rs` (`repl_interactive_break_edit_continue`, `repl_interactive_step_into_and_out`, `repl_interactive_eval_at_frame`). **Edit-and-continue covers every inline scalar** (`integer`/`float`/`single`/`boolean`/`character`) via `State::set_frame_literal` (type-directed parse + write, shared `frame_slot` lookup); `debug_set` evaluates the RHS against the frame first, so `n = n + 1` / `b = !b` work, and a type-mismatched edit is rejected. **Text + simple-enum live edits also land** (`set_frame_literal` `Type::Text` / `Type::Enum(_,false,_)` arms): a text **local** overwrites its owned `String` via `ptr::write` (no drop of the possibly-uninitialised prior slot — `reserve_frame` does not zero), a text **argument** repoints its 16-byte `Str` at a `Debugger::edited_text` buffer (stable for the run), and a simple enum writes its inline discriminant byte; gated on the local being shown at the pause. The same change fixed the text-**local** *read* (the renderer read every text slot as a `Str`, but a non-arg local is a 24-byte `String` — showed `""`), with a guarded read so an uninitialised local slot never crashes. **Scalar struct-field paths (`pt.x`) and scalar vector elements (`v[i]`) are now editable** (`set_frame_path` / `set_frame_element`, both in-place writes); a **whole-value** heap edit (`pt = Point{…}`, vectors, struct-enums, structs with text) now lands too, via **store-level adoption** (`materialize_heap_value` → `Stores::raise_floor` + `adopt_value_stores` + `State::set_frame_dbref`; see the Status note + M1a). Surfaced + fixed a latent round-trip bug: `render_frame_local` rendered a `float` `2.0` as bare `"2"` (re-typing as `integer` when the D1 seed re-binds it) — both it and `repl::float_literal` now share `state::loft_float_literal`. Covered by `tests/repl_session.rs::repl_interactive_edit_scalar_types` + `tests/repl.rs::interactive_breakpoint_edit_boolean`. **Record-and-continue stays** the off-stepping default (`last_hits`) for programmatic / conditional-breakpoint sweeps. **Why fn-scoped:** a bare or file:line number is *not* unique in the REPL — every input parses under the synthetic file `"<repl>"` with line numbers restarting at 1, so only the function is a unique anchor (a bare line is rejected with guidance). **`file:line` is unique only for file-based source** → it lands with the **file-run debugger** (a CLI entry point — break at `prog.loft:42`), a later slice. **Whole-value heap edit — LANDED (2026-06-09):** `pt = Point{…}` (and vectors, struct-enums, structs with text) replace a heap local at a pause via **store-level adoption** rather than the journal record-`Insert` replay the design first sketched — construction allocates a *whole new store per value* (`database_named`), which the per-store recording never captures and which `State::new` can't build over a clone-of-live, so the journal-apply path does not fit. The realised path: `debug_eval` → self-contained literal → `materialize_heap_value` builds it on a throwaway `State` with its store high-water raised above live's (`Stores::raise_floor`, value-stores land on live-free slots) → graft the whole value-stores at coinciding slots (`Stores::adopt_value_stores`, **no `DbRef` remap**) → repoint the frame slot (`State::set_frame_dbref`); the suspended frame is untouched. **File-run debugger landed (2026-06-09, M5a):** `loft debug <file>:<line>` (`run_file_debug` + `State::set_breakpoint_file_line`) debugs a real file with the same `(dbg)` prompt — G1 is complete. **`debug_eval` on a *text* frame value now works** — the pre-existing REPL value-snapshot crash ([#293](https://github.com/loft-lang/loft/issues/293), fixed) double-freed when capturing a text value that borrowed a local `String`; the snapshot now routes text through a store-resident `vector<text>` wrap (`ReplSession::capture_typed`), so text edits accept any expression RHS. |
| **G1-span** — **breakpoint line resolution** (surfaced + **FIXED** during G1) | **DONE.** Breakpoints resolved against the sparse `source_spans` (emitted only at fault-prone arithmetic `+ - * / % << >>`), so a body with no such op (pure `if`/constant, a bare-var return, a plain assignment) had no breakable offset and silently never paused.  **Fix:** resolve against the dense **`line_numbers`** table instead — `code_pos → line`, emitted before the first op of *every* source line and **post-prologue** (lands after any `ReserveFrame`).  `set_breakpoint_fn_line` / `set_breakpoint_fn_start` / `breakable_lines` now use it, and stepping's per-op line uses a new `State::line_at` (was the sparse `source_loc_for`).  `source_spans` stays for runtime-error `file:line:col`.  Every body line is now breakable (`tests/debugger.rs::breakpoint_fires_without_arithmetic`, `breakable_lines_cover_non_arithmetic_lines`; the piped `interactive_breakpoint_edit_boolean` breaks a pure-`if` body).  **Method note:** the earlier "doesn't fire even at `code_position`" reading was a **stale-binary artifact** — `cargo build --release --lib` doesn't rebuild the `loft` *binary*, so the manual REPL probes ran old code; a fresh `--bin loft` build confirmed the fix. |
| **G2** — browser surface: `loft-dap` protocol + web UI (gutter, variables, call stack, REPL console) — the *natural home* | Open |

## Phase ordering

1. **A + C together** — a registry that can pause the interpreter at a line is the
   spine; nothing is observable until execution can stop at a point. *(first cut
   landed — the tracer-bullet slice.)*
2. **D0 (frame read)** — *done*: args + non-arg locals (liveness-gated), every
   value type. Extended `capture_break_frame` / `render_frame_local`; no new
   dependency.
3. **D1 (frame → REPL bridge)** — *first cut done*: a paused frame becomes an
   inspectable REPL via `seed_frame` / `from_parser`, evaluating against the frame's
   own-format literals. The @PLN14 store-resident env is the *upgrade* (exact
   value-for-value seeding + frame mutation/write-back), not a prerequisite for
   read-eval. **D2 (live-frame eval)** is its named, **elevated** open upgrade —
   eval against the frame's live `DbRef`s instead of a reconstruct-from-literal clone
   (which yields null on a bare `vector`); promoted by the `story`/crawler consumer,
   whose `vector<struct>` data is exactly where the limit bites.
4. **F (debug API)** — *done*: suspend (`enable_stepping`) → step into/over/out
   (`debug_step`) → edit (`set_frame_value`, fed by `value_of`) → resume picks up
   the change. **G1 (terminal surface)** wraps A–F as the headless API; the REPL is
   already the front-end, so the engine ships useful before any browser work.
5. **B (interpret-scope)** — for breakpoints reached through *compiled* code (the
   only place it's needed; user code is already interpreted). **B1 done**
   (`interpret_set` reachability), **B2 done** (`unmark_for_debug` = un-mark
   `def.native` on the set + recompile → interpreted), **B3-introspection done**
   (`break_stack`). **Deferred**: B3 on-demand *switching* mid-run (on-stack deopt,
   Q7) → lavition engine integration.
6. **E (conditional/test)** — *first cut done*: `frame_holds` evals a condition
   against the seeded frame to filter recorded hits (thin, as predicted, once D1
   existed). In-loop skip is a refinement.
7. **G2 (DAP + browser UI)** — the protocol adapter (`loft-dap`, scoped under
   @PLN/09-lsp LSP.3) and the web-IDE surface consume the same API as G1.

## Path to the full debugger

Where it stands: breakpoints · step into/over/out/continue · conditional breaks ·
REPL-at-frame (read + eval any expression, every type) · live edit of every inline
scalar, text, simple-enum, **scalar struct-field paths, scalar vector elements, and
now whole heap values** (`pt = Point{…}`, vectors, struct-enums, structs with text —
via store-level adoption: `Stores::raise_floor` + `adopt_value_stores` +
`State::set_frame_dbref`) · **undo/redo** of every edit kind (`:undo`/`:redo`, per-edit
journals, per-pause-point) · the **file-run debugger** (`loft debug prog.loft:42` —
break in a real file, not just the REPL) · **watchpoints** (`:watch pt.x` — pause when
a heap region changes, via the per-op poll) · the **store change journal** built through its core (two-file
binary model; `Modify`/`Insert`/`Free` record + apply/revert; the keystone `claim_at`
fuzz-verified — probe #6; the recording layer + `Stores` drain). The remaining path to a
complete, host-agnostic, persistable debugger, ordered by dependency.
*Correctness is not re-argued per slice — each is built to the reliability discipline
already homed in [GOALS.md § Purpose](../../GOALS.md#purpose--what-loft-is-for) (the
"software that doesn't fail" aim), [DESIGN_PROTOCOL.md](../../DESIGN_PROTOCOL.md), and
the `engineering-rigor` skill; the journal's invariant lives in
[STORE_JOURNAL.md](STORE_JOURNAL.md).*

**M1 — finish the edit surface (engine).** Make *any* value editable at a break.
- **M1b — nested struct-field scalar paths** (`pt.x = 9`, `pt.inner.x = 9`): **LANDED
  (2026-06-09).** `State::set_frame_path` walks the dotted chain summing inline field
  offsets in the same record (nested structs are flattened — the address `ShowDb`
  reads, so the write round-trips) and writes the scalar leaf; `debug_set` splits the
  path. Correct by construction (in-place, no allocation). Tests:
  `live_edit_nested_struct_path_resumes_with_new_value` + rejections + interactive.
- **M1b-vec — vector-element edits** (`v[i] = 5`): **LANDED (2026-06-09).**
  `State::set_frame_element` resolves the element type / stride from the vector type
  (`content(vec_tp)` / `size(elem_tp)`, mirroring the interpreter's own element access)
  and writes the scalar at `8 + i·stride`; `debug_set` routes a `[` LHS. Verified
  end-to-end (the resumed program reads the edited element) + rejection cases
  (out-of-range / negative / non-vector / non-scalar). Tests:
  `live_edit_vector_element_resumes_with_new_value`, `vector_element_edit_rejects`.
- **M1a — whole-value heap edits** (`pt = Point{…}`, vectors, struct-enums, structs
  with text): **LANDED (2026-06-09).** Built **store-level**, not via the journal's
  record-`Insert` replay: construction makes a *whole new store per value*
  (`database_named`) that the per-store recording can't see and that `State::new` can't
  build over a clone-of-live, so the journal-apply path the design sketched does not
  fit. The realised flow — `debug_eval` → self-contained literal → build it on a
  throwaway `State` with its store high-water raised above live's
  (`Stores::raise_floor`, so value-stores land on live-free slots) → graft the whole
  value-stores in at their coinciding slots (`Stores::adopt_value_stores`, **no `DbRef`
  remap**) → repoint the frame slot (`State::set_frame_dbref`). The suspended frame is
  untouched (separate State + stack). Tests: `repl_interactive_edit_whole_struct`,
  `…_whole_value_matrix` (nested-inlined struct · vector · struct-with-text — each
  resumes with the edit and leaves a second heap local intact), `…_frame_ref_and_reject`
  (constructor over live frame fields + clean rejection of an unresolvable / mistyped
  RHS). The `claim_at`/journal substrate stays load-bearing for the in-place edits,
  undo (M2), and the relocating-grow.

**M2 — undo / redo (journal-driven) — LANDED (2026-06-09).** Every interactive edit
(scalar, text, enum, struct-field, vector-element, whole-value) records, into a
**per-edit `Journal`**, the before/after bytes of exactly the region(s) it overwrites;
`:undo` (`:u`) reverts the top journal onto a redo stack, `:redo` (`:r`) re-applies it,
and a fresh edit forks the timeline (clears redo). The chokepoint is `debug_set`
(`begin_edit_journal` arms it, `commit_edit_journal` pushes on success); the three
write-sites bracket their write with `edit_before` (snapshot) / `edit_after`
(`Journal::record_modify`). Insight: **every edit's undo is one or more region
`Modify`s** — even the whole-value edit (a 12-byte frame-slot `DbRef` swap; the
replaced value's stores leak symmetrically, as M1a already accepts) — so M2 reuses the
existing journal `record/apply/revert` with no new op. Undo is **per-pause-point**:
`debug_step` clears the stacks, because resuming reuses frame stack slots. Tests:
`repl_interactive_undo_redo_scalar` (empty / stack / fork), `…_undo_resumes_with_reverted_value`
(the revert reaches resume), `…_undo_redo_heap_kinds` (field / element / text-bearing
struct / whole-value). User-facing reference: [REPL.md § Paused at a breakpoint](../../REPL.md).

**M3 — watchpoints (data breakpoints) — LANDED (2026-06-09).** `:watch pt.x` /
`:watch v[i]` pauses a resumed run when a later write changes the watched **scalar heap
region**, reporting old → new. **Mechanism correction:** the per-store `generation`
counter the design first named only fires on *structural* ops (claim/delete/resize),
**not** in-place `addr_mut` field writes — so a field watch can't lean on it. The
realised mechanism is a **per-op poll** in the resume loop (`debug_step`): after each
op, re-read each watched region and pause (one op past the write) on the first that
differs. Cheap (a few regions, only while debugging) and reuses the field/element
region resolvers (`path_region` / `element_region`, extracted from the edits).
`Debugger::{watchpoints, last_watch}` + `State::{add_watchpoint, poll_watchpoints,
take_watch_hit}`; `:watch` / `:watch clear` at the prompt. Tests:
`repl_watchpoint_fires_on_field_change` (fires twice, reports old→new),
`repl_watchpoint_vector_element_and_reject`. **Remaining:** a whole-record / arbitrary
store-region watch (today: scalar field / element only); a value-*predicate* watch
(break when `x < 0`, not just on any change) folds into the **rich breakpoints** of
M5d (the condition reuses **E**).

**M4 — persistence & time-travel (the WAL matures).**
- **M4a — persistent journal**: `open()` + mmap + recovery (durable count,
  trust-to-last-entry). With the data and (loft2) schema stores mmapped, this is the
  single-level store — the AS/400 aim, referenced from GOALS, not restated here.
- **M4b — time-travel**: a whole-execution journal (funnel the stack-frame raw
  writes) → step *backward* by reverse-replay. Needs the per-op recording extension
  STORE_JOURNAL flags as out of the edit-scope.

**M5 — surfaces (where it lives).** All consume the unchanged A–F host-agnostic API.
- **M5a — file-run entry** (`prog.loft:42`) — **LANDED (2026-06-09).** `loft debug
  <file>:<line>` loads a real `.loft` file (parsed under its own path), breaks at the
  line, auto-runs `main()` to it, and drops into the same interactive `(dbg)` prompt
  the REPL uses — turning the REPL-trapped A–F engine into a tool you point at a file.
  `file:line` is unique for a real file, so the REPL's function-scoping constraint
  vanishes: `State::set_breakpoint_file_line` scopes to the user file's function defs
  (by `position.file` basename, so stdlib's identical line numbers are excluded) and
  reuses `set_breakpoint_fn_line`. `ReplSession::{load_program,add_file_breakpoint,
  breakable_lines_in_file}` + `repl::run_file_debug` (validate → auto-run → hand to the
  shared `run_loop`); `main.rs` `loft debug` dispatch. Tests:
  `repl_file_debugger_breaks_at_file_line` (scopes to the user fn, not stdlib),
  `…_unbreakable_line`, `…_end_to_end` (the full piped CLI flow). User reference:
  [REPL.md § Debugging a file](../../REPL.md).
- **M5b — G2 browser / DAP** (the *natural home*): `loft-dap` (under @PLN/09-lsp
  LSP.3) + web UI — gutter breakpoints, variables panel, call stack, REPL console.
- **M5c — embedded**: the lavition in-game console drives the same API in-process.
- **M5d — agent / scripted surface** (the headless **batch** front-end). The `(dbg)`
  prompt (G1) and the browser (M5b) are *human* surfaces — drive-by-hand, react to
  output. An **agent** (or any non-interactive consumer — a test, a CI gate, a script)
  needs the inverse: **declare what to observe, run once, read a structured result.**
  The friction it removes is the round-trip: a human steps and looks; a non-interactive
  driver must commit a command sequence blind and re-run to react.

  *The insight.* An agent does not want to *interactively step* — it wants to
  *declaratively observe*. So this is **not** "the REPL but scripted"; it is a **batch
  observation runner**. It adds **no new debug semantics** — every capability is the
  same A–F engine, reached declaratively instead of interactively (Goal E: one engine,
  now four surfaces).

  *The load-bearing enabler — rich breakpoints (condition + actions), shared by every
  surface.* A breakpoint grows two optional facets:
  - a **condition** — `break update if entity.health < 0` breaks only when a predicate
    over the frame holds. **Reuses E** (`frame_holds`), promoted from a post-run filter
    to an in-loop check. (This alone is the cheapest, highest-value add — it turns
    "fails on one call in 10 000" from un-debuggable into one stop.)
  - an **action list + `stop` flag** — on each hit, evaluate a list of expressions and
    emit them; `stop` pauses (a breakpoint), `!stop` continues (a **tracepoint**: a
    non-interactive log of values at a point — *"trace `entity.x, entity.y` every time
    `move` runs"* yields a full structured trace with zero round-trips, the agent's
    bread and butter).

  *The script.* A line-oriented DSL — the same verbs as the prompt plus the
  rich-breakpoint forms — fed via `loft debug prog.loft --script <file>` (`-` = stdin)
  or inline `--eval`:
  ```
  break update if entity.health < 0     # conditional breakpoint
  trace move { entity.x, entity.y }     # tracepoint: emit these, continue
  watch entity.health                   # data breakpoint (M3)
  run                                   # run main() (or --entry <fn>) under the above
  ```

  *The output.* Structured + parseable: default a stable `EVENT label #n | k=v …` line
  format (human + agent readable); `--format json` emits one JSON object per event (the
  agent path — loft already has `to_json`). Events: `BREAK` · `TRACE` · `WATCH` ·
  `DONE`. A `--max-steps` / `--max-hits` budget bounds a non-interactive run so it can
  never hang.

  *Reuse + invariant.* A thin driver over what exists: parse the script → set rich
  breakpoints / watches on the **M5a file-run** `State` → run → serialize each hit's
  frame + actions. **No new engine** — the same breakpoints, conditions (E), watches
  (M3), and frame-eval (D1) the prompt uses, addressed declaratively. The invariant:
  *anything expressible at the `(dbg)` prompt is expressible in the script, and
  vice-versa* — the surfaces differ only in interaction model, never in capability.

  *The contract.* The script is sugar over a JSON request/response + event **wire
  protocol** — the one interface the agent (`--rpc`), the browser (`--serve`), and a
  future DAP editor all speak. It is designed in full, *before* any server code, in
  [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md): one message per `(dbg)` capability, no UI-only or
  agent-only message, the server a thin serialiser over the engine. The browser surface
  (M5b) is then "the same protocol with a UI," reusing the viewer
  ([14-viewer-lsp-bridge](../../lib_plans/future/14-viewer-lsp-bridge/README.md)'s
  local-sidecar pattern) for the shell.

  *Phasing.* (1) **rich breakpoints — LANDED (2026-06-09).** A unified `BreakSpec`
  (location + condition + actions + stop); `:break <loc> [if <cond>]` (conditional) and
  `:trace <loc> <exprs>` (tracepoint) at the prompt; a driver-side `ReplSession::
  resolve_pause` loop that, after each hit, evaluates the condition against the frame
  (reusing `debug_eval` = E) and auto-resumes if false, or for a tracepoint evaluates +
  emits the actions and continues — so the engine pauses at the offset and the driver
  (which has the parser) decides. `State::{set_breakpoint_* → Option<offset>,
  paused_at_breakpoint}`; tests `repl_conditional_breakpoint_breaks_only_when_true`,
  `repl_tracepoint_logs_and_continues`. It is a shared engine capability, not
  agent-only. (2) **the `--rpc` server — LANDED (2026-06-09).** `src/rpc.rs` +
  `loft debug --rpc`: the NDJSON stdio driver, a thin serialiser over `ReplSession`
  (one message ⇄ one engine method). Requests parse through loft's inbuilt JSON
  (`crate::json::parse`); `eval` values serialise through loft's inbuilt serializer
  (struct/enum `.to_json()` → JSON object, scalars → raw JSON). Program `print` is
  captured by a thread-local sink (`print_or_capture`, hooked in `fill.rs`) and streamed
  as `output` events so it never corrupts the protocol on stdout. `tests/rpc.rs` drives
  the whole set over a pipe (launch → setBreakpoints incl. `condition` → run → `stopped`
  → eval → continue → `output` → `terminated`); proven end-to-end through the binary.
  *Resolved by **D2** (LANDED, above):* `eval` of a bare heap local now reads the live
  `DbRef` in place (`show_json`), so a bare `vector` renders as a real JSON array (was
  null) and a struct as a JSON object — faithfully, no reconstruct/clone. A heap *field
  path* (`eval s.fi_q`) is the next increment (`eval s` shows the field meanwhile). (3) the
  **`--serve` WebSocket + browser** build the surfaces on it — see M5e.

- **M5e — the server-backed IDE** (the *lavition editor*) — **design:
  [IDE.md](IDE.md).** The browser surface grown from "debugger UI" into a usable IDE:
  **editor**, **Run / Test / Suite** buttons, the **debugger inside**, and a **dual
  console** (compiler diagnostics + program output). Its defining property is that there
  is **no interpreter in the browser** — the real engine runs locally and the actual game
  renders in a **native OpenGL window**; the browser is a thin view that edits source,
  shows debug state, and sends intents. That is not a limitation but the *enabler*: a real
  game (GPU, native speed, the whole filesystem, the real test suite, breakpoints in the
  running game, hot-swap a function over the shared store) is impossible in a serverless
  WASM sandbox ([`07-web-ide`](../../lib_plans/future/07-web-ide/README.md), a separate
  product) and natural once the engine is local. It **extends the protocol** with a
  workspace layer (`listFiles`/`readFile`/`writeFile`/`compile`/`runTests`/`runSuite`/
  `launchGame`/`reload`), same one-message-⇄-one-method invariant, reusing the plan-35
  viewer shell. Six slices (foundation `--serve`+shell+Run → compiler console → editor →
  debugger UI → test/suite runners → the game loop with native OpenGL + live hot-swap);
  slices 1–5 are a usable IDE for any loft program, slice 6 is the lavition payoff. This
  is [`live-prototyping`](../../GOALS.md) made literal — see [LAVITION.md](../../LAVITION.md).

**M6 — on-stack deopt (Q7, deferred).** True mid-flight introspection without loop
re-entry (a non-looping program, the *exact* current invocation, step-out into a
compiled caller *now*). The main-loop re-entry side-steps it for lavition's
frame-loop domain; the general case needs cdylib-side safepoint metadata — the hard
part HotSpot pays for. Revisit only if the non-loop / exact-frame case becomes
load-bearing.

## Open design questions

1. **Interpret scope — static vs on-demand.** "Everything that calls that routine"
   needs the *dynamic* call-chain interpreted so the whole stack is introspectable.
   Static (all transitive callers) is conservative and can engulf the program;
   on-demand (compiled until a frame that can transitively reach a breakpoint is
   entered, then switch that frame + descendants) is precise but needs a "can-reach
   a breakpoint" call-graph analysis. Lean on-demand; B builds the reachability.
2. **Pause granularity.** Per-source-line (DAP-natural) vs per-bytecode-op. Line is
   the user model; map line → the offset range and pause at the first op of the
   line.
3. **Frame mutation semantics.** Editing a local at a break writes the
   store-resident env; on resume the frame must read the edited value. Does the
   seeded env *alias* the live frame's slots, or is it a copy written back on
   resume? (Aliasing is faithful but couples the REPL env to the live stack; copy
   + write-back is cleaner but must reconcile.) Same store-copy-vs-alias question
   @PLN14 Q2/Q4 raises — resolve once, shared.
4. **Compiled frames above the break.** If a caller is compiled (not yet switched),
   its frame isn't introspectable. Does step-out across a compiled frame degrade
   gracefully (show "compiled frame, no locals") or does B guarantee the whole
   reached chain is interpreted? Lean on the latter (B's job).
5. **Coroutine reuse depth.** The suspend hook should reuse the coroutine
   frame-snapshot/restore path, not a parallel one — confirm a breakpoint pause is
   expressible as the same suspend primitive (it is a yield to the debugger).
6. **Local liveness in bytecode units (the D0 blocker) — RESOLVED.** The variable
   table's `first_def`/`last_use` are *sequence* numbers (IR-walk order), the wrong
   unit for the runtime `code_pos`. But no codegen addition was needed: `State.vars`
   already records `code_pos → var_nr` for every variable reference (`generate_var`
   reads + `generate_set` writes), so a per-var **bytecode reference range** falls
   out by scanning it within the function's `[code_position, +code_length)`. D0
   gates a local by `first_ref <= bp_pc <= last_ref` — *safe* (a var inside its
   read-range is necessarily assigned), and it picks the right owner of a reused
   slot. The map is **read-dominated** (scalar first-assignments don't record a
   write pc), so the only residual is a defined-but-not-yet-read local before its
   first read: it under-shows, never reads garbage. A true def-based gate (record
   the missing scalar-write pcs) is a future refinement only if that residual
   bites.
7. **On-stack deopt — true mid-flight introspection (KNOWN, deferred, hard).**
   Introspecting a frame that already ran *compiled* **without** waiting for loop
   re-entry (a non-looping program, the *exact* current invocation, or step-out into
   a compiled caller *now*). HotSpot does it by reconstructing interpreter locals
   from JIT **safepoint metadata**. loft's compiled path is a **native, optimized
   Rust cdylib**, so for loft this means **inspecting the live stack of a running,
   optimized Rust frame** — the genuinely hard part: optimized native code keeps no
   safepoint→local map, the optimizer elides / coalesces / inlines locals, and only
   DWARF (lossy under `-O`) describes them. The **main loop side-steps it** for
   loft's domain — re-entry is free (see § Prior art) — so revisit only if the
   non-loop / exact-frame case becomes load-bearing. The realistic path is then
   **loft-emitted safepoints + debug metadata in the cdylib at known points** (the
   HotSpot bargain), *not* general optimized-Rust-stack walking.

## Cross-arc dependencies

- **@PLN12** (REPL + introspection, **finished**) — the interactive surface; the
  REPL-at-frame is a `ReplSession` over the paused frame, and the terminal surface
  (G1) is that REPL directly.
- **@PLN14** (store-resident REPL session) — **load-bearing**: the breakpoint frame
  *is* the store-resident environment. @PLN14 now carries the sharpening that its
  env must be seedable from an arbitrary live frame, not only typed bindings (sub-D1
  here consumes it).
- **N9/C71 per-function interpret dispatch + Goal-D parity** — the interpret-scope
  switch (B) and the invisibility of interpret-on-break (parity).
- **Coroutine suspend machinery** — the frame-snapshot primitive C reuses.
- **`loft-dap` / 09-lsp LSP.3** — the browser protocol surface (G2);
  **25-native-debug** is the `--native` GDB/LLDB complement (this plan is the
  interpreter-mode debugger); **lib_plans/07-web-ide** is the browser UI host.
