# 16.E — M5e: the server-backed IDE (the lavition editor)

> **Identity:** a design sub-doc of `@PLN16` (debugger). Slug `debug-ide`.
> **Status:** design — the browser surface that grows the debugger into a usable IDE.
> Builds on the shipped `--rpc` server ([PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md)) and the plan-35
> viewer shell. No browser-UI code yet; the engine side is largely already shipped.

## Why this exists — and why there is *no interpreter in the browser*

This is the **lavition editor**: the surface you author, run, debug, and *iterate* a
game from. Its defining constraint is also its defining strength —

> **The browser holds no interpreter and no language logic. The real loft engine runs
> locally; the actual game renders in a native OpenGL window. The browser is a thin view
> that edits source, shows debug state, and sends intents.**

That is not a compromise versus an "everything in WASM" playground — it is the *only*
model that can build real games:

| | server-backed IDE (this plan, M5e) | serverless WASM playground ([`07-web-ide`](../../lib_plans/future/07-web-ide/README.md)) |
|---|---|---|
| Runs the game | **native OpenGL window, full GPU, native speed** | sandboxed canvas, no native GPU, no threads-of-note |
| Filesystem | the real project on disk (assets, `lib/`, `tests/`) | IndexedDB only; no real FS |
| Test suite | runs the **whole project suite** natively | can run a single program, not a suite |
| Debugger | the @PLN16 engine, breakpoints in the *running game* | none |
| Live data | one shared store, edits hot-swap into the running game | fresh interpreter per run |
| Install | a local `loft` binary (or `make view`-style port-forward) | open a URL, zero install |

The two are **different products**. `07-web-ide` is the zero-install demo/teaching
surface; this is the working tool you make a game with. They share the WASM build and the
editor grammar, nothing else. The serverless one cannot host OpenGL, the filesystem, the
debugger, or hot-swap — so for the lavition use case the local engine is mandatory, and
once the engine is local the browser has *nothing left to interpret*. "No interpreter in
the browser" falls out of "the game runs natively," it is not a limitation we accepted.

This is [`live-prototyping`](../../GOALS.md) made literal: **a Rust main loop + loft over
one shared store, editing a single function and seeing it in the running game** — the IDE
is the seat you drive that loop from. See [LAVITION.md](../../LAVITION.md) (the engine) and
[`10-game-client`](../../lib_plans/future/10-game-client/README.md) / [`02-graphics`](../../lib_plans/future/02-graphics/README.md)
(the OpenGL runtime the game window uses).

## The invariant (extends the protocol invariant to the whole workspace)

> **Every IDE action — open, edit, save, compile, run, test, breakpoint, step, inspect,
> launch the game, hot-swap a function — is exactly one protocol message that is a thin
> call into one existing engine / `ReplSession` / workspace-host method. The browser
> renders engine state and emits intents; it never computes language results, and it
> never renders the game (the game renders itself, natively).**

This is [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md)'s "one message ⇄ one engine method" generalised from
*debug* to *workspace*. The re-assertion sites are the message table below: each row must
name a real method, and no IDE capability may live only in the browser (a leak that drifts)
or invent semantics the engine doesn't own. The load-bearing falsification — *is there an
IDE feature that cannot be one-message-one-method?* — has exactly one honest seam: the game
window is **not** browser-rendered. We make that explicit rather than hide it: the browser
surface and the game surface are two views of one local engine, and the IDE renders the
*dev* surface (code, diagnostics, variables, console), never the game's pixels.

## Architecture — three surfaces, one local engine

```

```

The data never leaves the machine — same shape as `make view` over an SSH port-forward.
The game window is a separate native surface the engine owns; the browser can *control* it
(run / pause / step / reload) but does not display it.

## The protocol extension — the workspace layer

The debug messages ([PROTOCOL.md § Requests/Events](PROTOCOL.md#requests-client--server))
are unchanged and carry the whole debugger. M5e adds a **workspace** layer on the same
envelope, same invariant — each row a thin call into an existing or one-line-new method.

### Requests (client → server)

| `req` | args | method | response |
|---|---|---|---|
| `listFiles` | `path?` | viewer's tree walk (`/tree`) | `{ok, entries:[{name, dir}]}` |
| `readFile` | `path` | host read (viewer's `/raw`) | `{ok, content}` |
| `writeFile` | `path`, `content` | host write **(sandboxed to the workspace root)** | `{ok}` |
| `compile` | `file` | `ReplSession::load_program` (parse + scope-check, no run) | `{ok}`, then a `diagnostics` event |
| `run` | `file`, `entry?` | `load_program` + run (== `launch`) | `{ok}`, then `output` / `stopped` / `terminated` |
| `runTests` | `file?` | `test_runner::run_tests` on a file (or `tests/`) | `{ok}`, then `testResult*` + `testSummary` |
| `runSuite` | `dir?` (default project) | `test_runner::run_tests` over the project | `{ok}`, then `testResult*` + `testSummary` |
| `launchGame` | `file`, `entry?` | run with the OpenGL window host (the `make game` path) | `{ok}`, then `gameState` |
| `reload` | `function?` | hot-swap one fn into the running game (per-fn interpret, N9/C71) | `{ok}`, `gameState` |
| `stop` | — | terminate the running program / game | `{ok}`, `terminated` |

`launch` / `setBreakpoints` / `setWatch` / `continue` / `step*` / `eval` / `setValue` /
`undo` / `redo` / `stackTrace` / `disconnect` are the **existing** debug set — they apply
to the same `file`, so debugging *is* "run with breakpoints," including breakpoints in the
running game's frame logic.

### Events (server → client)

| `event` | payload | emitted when |
|---|---|---|
| `diagnostics` | `file`, `items:[{line, col, level, message}]` | a `compile` / `run` produces parser/scope diagnostics — **the compiler console** |
| `output` | `category` (`stdout`/`trace`), `text` | the program / game prints, or a tracepoint fires — **the program console** (exists) |
| `testResult` | `name`, `status` (`pass`/`fail`), `message?`, `file`, `line?` | one test finishes (streamed, so the panel fills live) |
| `testSummary` | `passed`, `failed`, `durationMs` | a `runTests` / `runSuite` completes |
| `gameState` | `phase` (`running`/`paused`/`stopped`), `fps?` | the game window changes state |
| `stopped` · `terminated` | (see PROTOCOL.md) | a breakpoint fires / the run ends |

Two consoles fall straight out of two event streams: **compiler** = `diagnostics`,
**program** = `output`. No new rendering logic — the browser appends each event to its pane.

The one genuinely new *capability* is `writeFile` (the editor's save) — everything else is
a serialisation of a method that already exists. `writeFile` is the security seam, handled
under § Safety.

## The browser shell (reuse the plan-35 viewer)

The viewer (`tools/viewer/src/main.loft`: `server::listen` + routes `/`, `/tree`, `/file`,
`/raw`, `/static`) already serves a file tree and code-with-line-numbers. M5e adds, on the
same shell:

```
┌── tree ──┬──────────── editor (CodeMirror 6) ───────────┬─ Debug ─┐
│ src/     │  1  fn update(e: Entity) {                    │ vars    │
│  main    │ ●2    e.x = e.x + e.vx        ← gutter break  │  e.x 12 │
│  enemy   │  3    if e.x > 800 { … }                      │ watch   │
│ lib/     │  4  }                                          │ stack   │
│ tests/   │                                                │ update  │
├──────────┴───── toolbar: [Run ▶][Test][Suite][Debug][Game ▶][Reload]
│ ┌─ Compiler ──────────────┐ ┌─ Program ──────────────────┐ ┌─ Tests ─┐
│ │ enemy.loft:3:7 warning…  │ │ frame 0 spawned 4 enemies  │ │ ✓ 41    │
│ └──────────────────────────┘ └────────────────────────────┘ │ ✗ 2 →   │
```

Panels: **file tree** (`/tree`), **editor** (the `/file` pane made editable), **gutter
breakpoints** (click → `setBreakpoints`), **toolbar** (each button → one request),
**dual console** (compiler `diagnostics` + program `output`), **debug panel**
(variables / watch / call stack from `stopped` events — zero extra round-trips, the frame
ships whole), **tests panel** (`testResult` stream, click a failure → jump to the line, or
drop into the debugger on it).

The editor starts minimal (a line-numbered editable pane) and graduates to CodeMirror 6
with the loft grammar — the editor polish, hover, and squiggle work is already specced in
[`14-viewer-lsp-bridge/05-browser-editor`](../../lib_plans/future/14-viewer-lsp-bridge/05-browser-editor.md);
M5e consumes it rather than re-specifying it.

## Build slices (incremental — each independently usable)

Each slice: one transport/UI step, the protocol rows it lights up, the engine method
behind them (almost always already shipped), and a test in the `tests/rpc.rs` shape
(drive the messages over a pipe / WS, assert the JSON) plus a headless-chromium smoke
(the dev box ships chromium + both wasm targets).

1. **Foundation — `--serve` + shell + Run + program console — LANDED (2026-06-10).**
   `loft debug <file> --serve [--port <n>]` (`src/serve.rs`): an HTTP + WebSocket server on
   `127.0.0.1`. `GET /` returns a minimal shell (the file's source in a read-only pane, a
   **Run** button, a **Program** console); the shell opens a WebSocket and drives the *same*
   `handle()` driver as `--rpc` — one JSON request per text frame, `run` → `output` events
   stream into the console, then `terminated`. The transport is the only new code: a small
   inline SHA-1 + WS framing (test-vector verified, no new crate); the engine, protocol, and
   message set are unchanged. Program `print` rides the shared capture sink (`output`
   events), never the socket. Tests: `tests/serve.rs` drives the full path over a real
   socket (HTTP shell, WS handshake, launch → run → output → terminated) + unit tests for
   SHA-1 / the RFC 6455 accept key / frame round-trip. *Smallest visible IDE; proves
   transport + one console.* (Slice 1 shows the source inline rather than via a `/file`
   endpoint — the editor/`readFile` path is slice 3.) The live game loop (slice 6) is why
   this is a WebSocket, not request/response — it needs bidirectional server-push.
2. **Compiler console — `compile` + `diagnostics` — LANDED (2026-06-10).** A `compile`
   request (`ReplSession::compile` — parse-check, no run, no load; rolls back so it's
   repeatable) emits a structured `diagnostics` event (`{file, items:[{line, col, level,
   message}]}`) carrying **errors *and* warnings** (`load_program` drops warnings on
   success — `compile` is the console feed that keeps them). The shell gains the **dual
   console**: a Compiler pane that lists diagnostics (click → scroll to the line) over the
   Program pane, and the source is now **line-numbered** so a diagnostic marks its row
   (red/amber gutter). The shell `launch`es + `compile`s on connect and re-`compile`s on
   Run. *The dual console is complete.* (Full inline squiggles are the later 14-bridge R2
   drawing; slice 2 ships the list + a per-line gutter marker.) Tests:
   `tests/rpc.rs::rpc_compile_*` (warn + error), `tests/serve.rs::serve_ws_compile_streams_diagnostics`.
3. **Editor — editable pane + `writeFile` + save/reload — LANDED (2026-06-10).** The code
   pane is now an editable `<textarea id="src">` with a synced line-number **gutter** (a
   diagnostic colours its gutter line; click a console entry → scroll + caret to that line),
   a **dirty** indicator, and **Save** (Ctrl/Cmd+S or the button → `writeFile` → `compile`).
   **Run** became save → reload → run: it `writeFile`s a dirty buffer, then re-`launch`es and
   runs — because `run` re-executes the *launched* program, so an edit only takes effect after
   a fresh `launch` (the editor sequences `run` to fire **only if that launch succeeds**, so a
   syntax-broken buffer shows errors instead of silently running stale code). *You can now
   edit and re-run without leaving the browser.*
   - **Write core:** `ReplSession::write_file` + `set_workspace_file` — the one new write
     capability, **sandboxed to the single served file** (a path that canonicalises anywhere
     else — `..`, a symlink, an absolute escape — is refused; `--rpc` has no sandbox set, so
     it refuses every write). `writeFile {path, content}` protocol arm. Save is optimistic
     but **reconciled**: the dirty flag clears only when the `writeFile` reply (tracked by id)
     comes back `ok`.
   - Tests: `tests/serve.rs::serve_ws_writefile_saves_and_sandboxes` (save + sandbox refusal),
     `serve_http_shell_has_editable_source` (textarea + Save button + embedded source),
     `serve_ws_writefile_then_relaunch_runs_new_code` (the edit→save→reload→run loop).
4. **Debugger UI — gutter breakpoints + step controls + panels — LANDED (2026-06-10).**
   Click a gutter line → `setBreakpoints` (red marker, re-applied across edits); the
   `stopped` frame carries `line` (`paused_line`, moves as you step) → the editor marks +
   scrolls to the current line; toolbar step controls (Continue / Over / Into / Out, enabled
   only while paused, Run disabled mid-pause); the **variables** panel (beside the REPL when
   paused) shows the frame locals **bounded** (`show_loft_bounded`, depth 2 / 8 elems — a big
   struct shows `Big{…,nums:[…+8],inner:Big2{deep:[...]}}` instead of flooding; full value one
   `eval` away) with click-to-edit scalars (`setValue`); a **watch** panel re-`eval`s each
   expression on every stop. The bounded render came from unifying `ShowDb`/`DumpDb` into one
   renderer (commit 49ce332c). Engine was already shipped (A–F + M1–M3 + M5a) bar one line
   (`paused_line`). Test: `serve_ws_breakpoint_stops_with_line_and_locals`. Call-stack is the
   single current frame (multi-frame backtrace is a later add).
5. **Test + suite runners — `runTests` / `runSuite` + results panel.** Run a file's tests or
   the whole project suite; click a failure → jump to its line, or set a breakpoint and
   **Debug** it.
   - **`runTests` engine + protocol LANDED (2026-06-10):** `ReplSession::run_file_tests` —
     the file's zero-parameter user functions (the `loft --tests <file>` discovery; stdlib /
     library / generator / lambda fns skipped), each in a **fresh** `State` (clone-per-test
     isolation), faults caught (a panic *or* a typed `had_fatal`) and reported, not fatal to
     the rest. Reuses the runner's execution primitives WITHOUT its 1226-line CLI annotation
     machinery (`@EXPECT_FAIL` etc. are a suite-file concern, not an IDE one). Protocol:
     `runTests {file}` → one `testResult {name, passed, line, message?}` per test + a
     `testSummary {passed, failed}`. (Batched into the reply, not yet live-streamed — true
     trickle needs a mid-`handle` flush, shared with slice 6.)
   - **UI LANDED (2026-06-10):** a **Test** button in the toolbar runs the file's tests
     (saving a dirty buffer first), and a **Tests** panel (beside the REPL) lists each result
     ✓/✗ with a `passed/total` summary; a **failing row is clickable → jumps to its line** in
     the editor. Smoke-verified the served shell (`id="test"`/`tests`/`tlist`, `runTests`/
     `addTestRow`/`finishTests`); the protocol is covered by
     `serve_ws_run_tests_reports_pass_and_fail`.
   - **`runSuite` LANDED (2026-06-10) — the PACKAGE-aware runner** (`loft test` semantics, not
     a dir sweep): `ReplSession::run_suite` walks up from the served file to the nearest
     `loft.toml`, puts the manifest `entry`'s `src/` on the import path (+ the package's
     parent dir when it has dependencies, so siblings resolve), and runs every `tests/*.loft`
     through the per-file runner (`run_file_tests_with`). Each `testResult` carries its
     **`file`**; the `testSummary` adds `files`. No `loft.toml` upward → a clean error naming
     that, never a guess. UI: a **✓✓ Suite** button; rows show `file · name`; the summary adds
     the file count; click-to-jump stays single-file (a suite failure lives in another file —
     multi-file navigation is the later slice). Test:
     `serve_ws_run_suite_runs_package_tests` (a fixture package with 2 test files, pass+fail
     across them). *Slice 5 is complete.*
6. **The game loop (lavition) — `launchGame` + `reload` (hot-swap) + debug the running
   game.** **Game ▶** launches the program in a **native OpenGL window** (the `make game`
   host); editing a function + **Reload** hot-swaps just that function into the running
   game over the shared store (per-fn interpret on the compiled baseline, N9/C71); a
   breakpoint in game logic pauses the game and drops the same variables panel in the
   browser. *The full live-prototyping loop: edit → see it in the running game → breakpoint
   it.* Engine: the graphics runtime ([`02-graphics`](../../lib_plans/future/02-graphics/README.md)) +
   shared-store per-fn dispatch (N9/C71) — this slice is where the IDE *becomes the engine
   editor*.
   - **6a — the game-process layer LANDED (2026-06-10).** `launchGame {file}` spawns the
     file as a **real `loft` child process** (with the session's `--lib` dirs; the binary is
     the serve process's own executable, `LOFT_BIN` overriding for tests) — a frame loop /
     native window must never block the single-threaded serve loop, so a game is a process,
     not an in-session run. stdout/stderr are pumped by drain threads into a shared buffer;
     `gameStatus` polls drain it in chunks and report exit (the slot then clears, freeing a
     relaunch); `stopGame` kills the child (only ever the one this session spawned). One game
     at a time. UI: a **🎮 Game** toggle (launch ↔ ■ Stop), output into the Program pane via a
     500 ms poll; deliberately usable while paused (the game is its own process). Test:
     `serve_ws_game_launch_streams_and_stops` (finite game → output + `exit:0`; infinite loop
     → killed). This transport is exactly what the GL window uses the day the graphics lib
     lands — launching a windowed game is the same child process.
   - **6b — `reload` hot-swap + 6c — breakpoint-in-game: OPEN (the plan continues).**
     The real dependency is the **C71/N9 per-fn interpret-on-compiled-baseline execution
     model over a shared store** ([DESIGN_DECISIONS § C71](../../DESIGN_DECISIONS.md) — a
     design, not yet a build); faking hot-swap (e.g. by full restart) would ship the
     workaround as the feature, so 6b/6c wait for that build. **The engine-host design
     exploration is recorded in [ENGINE_HOST.md](../18-engine-host/ENGINE_HOST.md)** — the tiered execution
     model (interpret → WASM-swap → native baseline) and the main-loop IO contract
     (budgeted drain, completion-as-event, store-resident accumulation) that the C71
     build plan starts from.
     **Correction (2026-06-10, the library-register inspection):** the graphics runtime is
     NOT missing — `graphics` (with gridmesh/imaging/shapes) is a **published registry
     package** (`loft-lang/loft-libs-graphics`, signed index at `loft-lang/registry`), one
     `loft install graphics` away; the untracked `lib/graphics` dir on this branch is a
     migration leftover (runtime droppings, no sources). The parser already probes
     `~/.loft/lib/<id>/…` (`probe_user_installed` / `probe_registry_installed`, with an
     auto-install chain), and the moros libs on this branch declare `graphics = ">=0.1"` —
     so **6a's Game button should reach a real native GL window today** via an installed
     registry package. **Next step on this slice:** verify install → `use graphics` →
     `launchGame` end-to-end (upgrades 6a from "transport ready" to "verified with the
     window"), then 6b/6c when C71 gets its build plan.

Slices 1–5 make a usable IDE for a **self-contained** loft program (the stdlib is its only
dependency); slice 6 is the lavition payoff. They land in order; 1 is the prerequisite for
all. **Caveat (§ Library vs project below):** the serve session loads only the stdlib, so
programs that depend on *libraries* — including the real lavition consumers — are not yet
supported; that gap gates `runSuite` and the multi-file work.

## Library vs project — the dependency gap (open; evaluated 2026-06-10)

The IDE today is **stdlib-only and single-file**: `run_serve(stdlib_dir, port, file)` and
`ReplSession::new(stdlib_dir)` load *only* the standard library, against *one* file. That
fits a self-contained script or a small project, but **library development is unsupported**,
on three counts:

1. **No dependency resolution (the blocker).** A library's source + tests `use` its `src/`
   modules and its `loft.toml` deps. The serve session never loads `lib_dirs` or resolves
   `loft.toml`, and `loft debug <file> --serve` doesn't even accept `--lib` — so a file that
   `use`s any dependency cannot be opened / compiled / tested in the IDE. This breaks both
   libraries *and* projects that depend on libraries.
2. **Single-file vs multi-file package.** The IDE serves one file; a library is many
   (`src/*.loft` behind an `[library] entry`). No file tree / cross-file navigation.
3. **File-level vs package-level tests.** loft already has the package runner `loft test`
   (reads `loft.toml`, resolves deps, runs the whole package). The shipped `runTests {file}`
   is the file-level path (`loft --tests file.loft`) — dep-blind. `runSuite` must be the
   package-aware one.

**Why it matters:** the real lavition consumers (moros, dryopea) are projects that depend on
libraries (graphics, etc.), so the IDE-as-engine-editor vision *requires* dependency-aware,
multi-file support. Building more single-file UI on a stdlib-only base polishes a surface
that can't open its eventual programs.

**Clean direction (one change, at the session level):** thread `lib_dirs` (and ideally
`--project` / `loft.toml` resolution) into `run_serve` + `ReplSession`. Once the session
loads the libs, `load_program` / `compile` / `run` / `run_file_tests` all resolve `use` for
free — the runner code is unchanged. Then `runSuite` = the package-aware `loft test`. **Open
fork:** is the IDE targeting self-contained scripts (current) or full packages (the lavition
need)? The latter is the destination; `--lib` threading is the cheapest first step, best
done *before* more single-file UI.

**`--lib` threading LANDED (2026-06-10).** `loft debug <file> --serve [--lib <dir>…]` (and
`--rpc`) now collect the `--lib` import paths and pass them to `ReplSession::new_with_libs`,
so the served file can `use` libraries: a program that `use`s `plainlib` **launches, runs
(`[hi]`), and `runTests`-passes** with `--lib tests/lib`, and is correctly refused without it.
`run_file_tests` itself was fixed in the process — it parses the file **by path** in a fresh
parser (the clean single-parse `loft --tests` uses) and calls `execute_argv` with the **bare**
function name (it prepends `n_` itself — a double-prefix was making every native call an
"Unknown definition"). Tests: `serve_ws_run_tests_reports_pass_and_fail`, manual `--lib`
probes. **Re-load idempotency FIXED (2026-06-10):** `load_program` was additive, so
re-launching a `use`-program re-loaded its libraries → "Cannot redefine 'banner'" (the **Run**
button worked only *once* for a library program). It now **resets to a pristine stdlib + libs
parser before loading**, so a re-launch is a clean whole-program load — re-launching a
`use`-program twice both succeed, and a re-launch picks up the latest on-disk edit (verified).
Both callers (file-run debugger, rpc/serve `launch`) want fresh-load semantics; the REPL's
incremental path is `eval`, untouched. (Trade-off: re-parses the small stdlib per launch; a
baseline-parser cache is the perf follow-up.) **Still open before library dev is real:**
**`loft.toml` auto-resolution** (so deps resolve without explicit `--lib`) and **multi-file
navigation**. **Nuance from the library-register inspection (2026-06-10):** the parser
already resolves **installed registry packages** without any `--lib` — it probes
`~/.loft/lib/<id>/…` (`probe_user_installed` / `probe_registry_installed`, with a lockfile →
installed → auto-install chain on `use`). So the remaining `--lib` need is for **local
path-dep development** (a package's own `src/` + sibling deps, the `runSuite` shape); a
registry dep like `graphics = ">=0.1"` should resolve in the IDE today once installed.

**Re-evaluation (2026-06-10, probed): library development itself already substantially
works — this section's "unsupported" framing is superseded.** The verified state:

| Library-dev flow | State |
|---|---|
| **Run a library checkout's own suite** (open its entry file → ✓✓ Suite) | **WORKS** — probed: `runSuite` from `lib/moros_map/src/moros_map.loft` walks up to its `loft.toml`, resolves its `src/` + `native-auto`, **51/51 across 8 test files**. A `loft-libs-*` repo checkout is the same case. |
| **Consume registry deps** (`graphics = ">=0.1"`) | Designed-in (`~/.loft/lib` probes + auto-install); needs one install-and-run verification. |
| **Edit a dependency in place** (clone it beside the consumer) | Designed-in: every *local* probe (project lib, sibling package, `--lib`, manifests) runs **before** the installed/registry probes, so a local checkout **shadows** the installed version — the cargo-`[patch]` workflow for free. Needs one end-to-end verification. |
| **Edit across a library's files** | **THE gap.** The `writeFile` sandbox is single-file: a multi-src library runs its whole suite but only its served file is editable. "Multi-file navigation" is therefore not polish — it is the library-development blocker, and ranks accordingly. |

(The *publish* half of the remote-library story — `REGISTRY_SUBMIT` / `LIBRARY_AUTHORING` —
stays deliberately outside the IDE plan.)

## The REPL panel — a prime, context-switching element

A **REPL is a prime element** of the shell, always present so you can try things out at any
moment — and its **context follows execution state**:

- **Top-level** (idle / running, not paused): evaluate against the session top level —
  define a function, run a statement, eval an expression (`ReplSession::eval` + `value_of`,
  the normal REPL). This is the default.
- **Frame** (paused at a breakpoint): the context **switches to the debugger** — evaluate
  against the live paused frame (`debug_eval` = D1/D2), so the same input box now inspects
  and computes over the frame's locals.
- Leaving the breakpoint (continue / terminate → back to top level) **switches it back**.

**History is per context.** The top-level history persists for the session; each debug
context (one pause) gets its **own** history, **discarded when that context ends** — so
breakpoint experiments never pollute the top-level history, and a new pause starts clean.

*Protocol:* one `replEval` request routes by paused-state on the server (frame eval when
paused, top-level otherwise) and replies `{ok, value?, context:"top"|"frame", more?}`.
Program `print` during an eval streams as `output` events (the shared sink); the `context`
field + the existing `stopped` / `terminated` events are what the shell uses to switch the
prompt's context badge and its history buffer. The one correctness pin: **each input runs
exactly once** — `eval` already has side effects, so an expression's value must be rendered
from that run, not a second one (mirror the terminal REPL's parse-then-route of statement
vs expression).

*Multi-line input — a live, fully-editable buffer; server-authoritative completeness.* The
input is an auto-growing `<textarea>` you can **edit freely until the input is finished** —
**nothing is locked line-by-line** the way a terminal is. The whole buffer stays live, so you
can move the cursor up and fix an *earlier* line at any point before submitting. That is safe
because **`NeedMore` is non-mutating**: while the input is incomplete the engine commits
nothing, so every intermediate Enter is a no-op on the session and there is no half-applied
state to corrupt by going back to edit. The rules:

- **Enter at the end of the buffer = a submit-attempt** — the browser sends the *current full
  buffer*; the server runs `eval`. If it's incomplete (open brace, unterminated string,
  trailing operator) the reply is `{ok, more:true}` (the **`NeedMore`** signal) and the
  browser simply drops to a new line (a `…` continuation badge) and keeps the buffer editable;
  when the buffer is complete the value comes back and is echoed + cleared + pushed to history
  as **one** entry.
- **Enter in the middle of the buffer inserts a newline** — you're editing, not finishing.
- **Shift+Enter** forces a newline anywhere; **Ctrl/Cmd+Enter** force-submits the buffer;
  **Escape** abandons it (the partials were non-mutating, so nothing to undo).

The browser **never parses loft** — the engine owns "is this complete?", so the buffer is
correct for every construct (string braces, the `{{ }}` escaping) with no duplicated grammar
to drift, and each submit-attempt re-sends the *whole* (possibly re-edited) buffer, so the
server stays stateless across continuations and only the final complete buffer mutates. The
per-attempt round-trip is a sub-millisecond local call. Pasting a multi-line definition +
Enter just works (the buffer is complete → runs once).

*Error lines must point at the user's line — a fix the REPL panel needs.* Diagnostics are
already structured (line / col), so the panel can mark the offending REPL line exactly like
the compiler console — **but only after one correctness fix.** `eval` reports the right line
for a **definition** (it parses the input directly under `<repl>`), but for a **bare
expression / binding / statement** it wraps the input *after a textual replay of the session
body* (`fn replmain_N() -> … { <body> <input> }`, the D1 bridge), so the engine's diagnostic
line is relative to that wrapped source — **offset** from the user's input (measured: a
1-line `zzz + 1` reported `2:8`, `badvar` reported `3:2`; the offset varies with session
state). The clean fix lives **in the REPL eval path, which knows exactly how many prefix
lines it prepended**: subtract that prefix-line count from each diagnostic's `line` (clamp
≥ 1) before returning, so `replEval`'s reply carries **input-relative** lines and the browser
marks the right one with no guessing. (Long-term, the **@PLN14 store-resident env** removes
the textual body prefix entirely → correct lines for free; the subtraction is the bridge
until then.) The **column** is best-effort — the parser reports where it *noticed* the error,
not always the token start (`notavar` at col 3 surfaced as col 14) — so the panel anchors on
the line (a reliable gutter mark + message) and treats a precise column underline as a bonus.

*BUILT (2026-06-10).* `ReplSession::repl_eval` (context routes frame `debug_eval` vs
top-level `eval`, returns `{context, more, value, diagnostics}`) → `replEval` protocol
request (the transport drains the eval's own printed output into the REPL pane, distinct from
a program `run`) → the shell REPL bar (context badge top/frame, scrollback, an auto-growing
textarea with the live-buffer multi-line model above, per-context history with the frame
history discarded on context change). Tests: `tests/rpc.rs` replEval drive +
`tests/serve.rs::serve_ws_repl_eval_top_level`. *Slot:* top-level REPL works now; the
frame-context switch lights up with **slice 4** (the debugger UI raises `stopped`).

*Verified position findings (the real-use-case payoff).* Driving `replEval` with errors at
known positions surfaced **two distinct bugs** (not one):

- **Bug 1 — the REPL wrapper's +1 line offset — FIXED (2026-06-10).** An expression /
  binding evaluated inside `fn replmain_N() { <body> <input> }` had its diagnostic line
  offset by the synthetic header + replayed `body`. `ReplSession::map_input_lines` subtracts
  that prefix in `eval`'s wrapped paths (the def path parses directly, so it's untouched), so
  an expression error now points at the line the user typed. Verified against the matrix
  (`nope`/`1 + nope` → line 1; multi-line expr → line 2); regression test
  `tests/rpc.rs::rpc_repl_eval_error_line_is_input_relative`.
- **Bug 2 — the parser reports where it *halted*, not the token — FILED [#302](https://github.com/loft-lang/loft/issues/302).**
  A clean file-level matrix (`/tmp/p_followups/d{1..5}.loft`) settled the real shape: the
  **line is correct**; only the **column** is wrong — every expression diagnostic
  (`Unknown variable`, and the `expected <T>, got <U>` type-mismatch) points at the
  **end-of-statement** `;` rather than the offending node's start (e.g. `undefinedvar` at
  col 11 → reported col 24), because `diagnostic!(self.lexer, …)` uses the lexer's *current*
  position after the operand is consumed. (The "def-body on the next line" symptom in the
  earlier REPL read was a **probe-contamination artifact** — `let`/missing-`;` syntax I'd
  written; loft has no `let` and statements need `;`. With valid syntax the line is right.)
  A **second facet**: an **undefined type** in a struct literal mis-reports as
  `Expect token ;` (wrong message *and* kind) instead of `unknown type '…'`. Fix plan
  (unchanged): add `Lexer::diagnostic_at(pos, …)` (the `Diagnostics::add_at` plumbing already
  takes an explicit position) and thread the operand's start position into
  `known_var_or_type` (and the struct-literal type site) — ~6 call sites, **0 test-position
  regression risk** (no loft test pins a column). Benefits files + the compiler console too,
  not just the REPL. Deferred per "ignore for now"; tracked on #302.

## Dogfood driver — the `story` / crawler roguelike

The first real consumer is the **`story` roguelike** (a sibling loft project, the "crawler"
— a pure-loft Angband-like: hex sim, procedural generation, monster AI, combat, loot, XP),
agent-built, shipping native via `make play` (OpenGL) and WebGL via `make game` →
`story.html`, at a shippable vertical slice. It is the right driver for three reasons:

- **Its bug class *is* the debugger's reason to exist.** The crawler's dominant pain is
  **silent wrong-results in store/heap-lifetime code** — struct-vector index + `??`, struct
  copies dropping a `text` field, cross-module `&Struct` mutation lost, struct-field vector
  growth desyncing (its `LOFT_ISSUES.md` C1–C5, C18; the family of loft #248). For that
  class, `print` is *worse than useless*: one entry is a literal **Heisenbug** (adding a
  `println` flips the result), and the project's own `CLAUDE.md` warns its agent "don't
  trust print-debugging." The debugger's answer is exactly what print can't do —
  **non-intrusive observation** (the D0 variables panel reads the live frame and injects no
  op), **watchpoints** (pause at the desyncing write — tailor-made for the C18 parallel-array
  desync), and **conditional breakpoints** (catch "the 3rd call onward" / "1-in-N element").
- **It is the slice-6 game, already.** Native OpenGL + WebGL, with a deferred v1.1 UI backlog
  (the Character Page, inventory screen, quick-slot bar) authored to live in `view.loft` /
  `story.loft` so *both* renderers get it — precisely the edit-a-function-see-it-in-the-
  running-game loop slices 3 + 6 deliver. Its deferred **live ticking spawner** is C18
  (struct-field vector growth) — watchpoint-shaped work waiting for this tool.
- **It is also the debugger's honest stress test.** The debugger **shares the store engine**
  with the very bugs the crawler hunts, so for the store-lifetime family it is an
  *observation* aid, not immunity: the bare-heap-`eval` fault behind [README § **D2**](README.md)
  is itself a member of that family, and the crawler's data is *all* `vector<struct>` —
  exactly where it bites. That is why D2 (live-frame eval) is elevated, not polish: trustworthy
  heap eval is load-bearing for this consumer. The variables panel (live-frame render) is the
  robust surface today; bare-heap `eval` is the fragile one.

`LOFT_ISSUES.md`'s C1–C20 doubles as a **ready-made validation matrix** — *"can the debugger
observe each better than `print` could?"* Running it both proves the tool and surfaces the
next substrate gap (the bet: it re-confirms D2 as the priority). The immediate dogfood move,
before any browser code: the next time the agent hits a silent wrong-result in the crawler's
v1.1 work, drive `--rpc` with a **watchpoint** instead of adding a `println`. *(The debugger
is interpreter-mode, so it covers the crawler's interpreter-bug class but not its
codegen-divergence (C9/C13), toolchain (C15), or GL (C16/C17) classes — those need the
native / graphics tooling.)*

## Reuse + one-home map

| Piece | Reuses | New here |
|---|---|---|
| Transport | the `--rpc` `handle()` driver (`src/rpc.rs`); loft's socket stack (`server` lib / multiplayer) | WS framing of the same messages |
| Shell | plan-35 viewer (`/tree`, `/file`, `/static`) | toolbar, panels, gutter |
| Editor polish | [`14-bridge/05`](../../lib_plans/future/14-viewer-lsp-bridge/05-browser-editor.md) (squiggles, hover, CodeMirror) | wiring to `diagnostics` events |
| Debug | the entire @PLN16 A–F engine + protocol | UI only |
| Compile / test | `ReplSession::load_program`, `test_runner::run_tests` | structured `diagnostics` / `testResult` events |
| Game + hot-swap | [`02-graphics`](../../lib_plans/future/02-graphics/README.md) OpenGL host, N9/C71 per-fn dispatch, the one shared store | `launchGame` / `reload` messages |
| Language intelligence (go-to-def, completion) | [`09-lsp`](../../lib_plans/future/09-lsp/README.md) `loft-lsp` | later; not v1 |

## Safety

- **`writeFile` is sandboxed to the workspace root** — the server canonicalises the path
  and refuses any write that escapes the root (no `..`, no absolute paths outside). This is
  the one new write surface; everything else is read or run.
- **Bounded runs + panic isolation** (PROTOCOL.md § Safety) — a `run` / `runSuite` /
  `launchGame` honours `--max-steps`; a fault is caught and reported as `terminated`, never
  killing the server.
- **Local by default.** The server binds `localhost`; remote use is an explicit SSH
  port-forward (the `make view` pattern), so the data and the game stay on the machine.
- **The game window is native, not piped to the browser** — no frame-streaming surface to
  secure, no GPU in the browser; the IDE only sends control intents (`launchGame` / `stop`
  / `reload`) and reads `gameState`.

## Testing strategy

- **Protocol-level** (the spine): extend the `tests/rpc.rs` shape — drive each new message
  over a pipe / in-memory WS and assert the JSON: `compile → diagnostics`,
  `writeFile → readFile` roundtrip, `runTests → testResult* + testSummary`.
- **Browser smoke**: a headless-chromium script connects to a `--serve` instance, clicks
  Run, asserts the Program console fills — the `check_html_bundle.mjs` real-render shape.
- **Game loop**: the existing GL test harness (`make test-gl-headless` / `-smoke` /
  `-golden`) gates `launchGame` + `reload`; a hot-swap test asserts a function edit changes
  the next rendered frame.

## What this is NOT (boundaries)

- **Not [`07-web-ide`](../../lib_plans/future/07-web-ide/README.md)** — that is the
  serverless WASM playground (a different product; see the table up top). M5e never runs
  the interpreter in the browser.
- **Not a scene / asset editor yet** — visual scene editing is
  [`13-scriptable-scenes`](../../lib_plans/future/13-scriptable-scenes/README.md); M5e edits
  *code* and drives the game, it does not yet place entities visually.
- **Not language intelligence** — completion, go-to-def, refactor are
  [`09-lsp`](../../lib_plans/future/09-lsp/README.md); M5e ships diagnostics (free from the
  compiler) and leaves the rest to the LSP surface.

## Cross-references

- [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md) — the wire contract M5e extends; the debug message set is
  unchanged, the workspace layer above is additive.
- [README.md](README.md) — the @PLN16 sub-arc table; M5e is the browser surface, M5d the
  agent surface, both over the one protocol.
- [LAVITION.md](../../LAVITION.md) / [GOALS.md](../../GOALS.md) — the engine and the
  live-prototyping purpose this IDE is the seat for.
- [`02-graphics`](../../lib_plans/future/02-graphics/README.md),
  [`10-game-client`](../../lib_plans/future/10-game-client/README.md) — the native OpenGL
  game runtime the **Game ▶** surface launches.
- [`14-viewer-lsp-bridge`](../../lib_plans/future/14-viewer-lsp-bridge/README.md) — the
  viewer-shell + local-sidecar pattern and the browser-editor polish M5e consumes.
