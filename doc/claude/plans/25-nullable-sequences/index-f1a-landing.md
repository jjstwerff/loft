# @PLN25 — INDEX (`v[i]`) FLIP: the F1a landing phase (START HERE next session)

Cold-start entry point for landing the index (`v[i]` → `τ?`) flip as the default. The
**foundation is already built and committed** (dev-gated, inert); this doc is the step-by-step
to flip it ON without breaking the tree. Read [RESUME.md § MOST RECENT](RESUME.md) first for the
one-paragraph context, then this.

## State (what's already done, on `tuxedo-pln85-fuzz-proof-gate`, pushed)

- **Mechanism (`c0aad2b2`, `c58d7623`):** `parse_vector_index` (fields.rs) sets `self.last_index_fit`
  for each SCALAR `v[i]` read; `parse_index` (fields.rs ~656) wraps the element type `Optional`
  when `!last_index_fit`, **gated behind `LOFT_INDEX_DEV`** (temporary dev-gate; folds into
  `pln25_dn1_enabled` at the end).
- **Fit-proofs (`index_provably_fit`, fields.rs)** — a `v[i]` types NON-null when the index is:
  - any compile-time constant (`self.const_int(index).is_some()` — covers `v[0]`, `v[-1]`, `v[2+3]`);
  - a for-loop iter var (`self.vars.is_active_loop_var(v)` — no separate stack);
  - proven `< len(vec)` by an enclosing `if idx < len(vec)` guard (`index_bounded: Vec<(u16, VecKey)>`,
    fed in `parse_if` (control.rs) by REUSING `operators::collect_guard_pairs`, THEN-only).
- **Reject mechanism proven:** undefended general-var index into a non-null store rejects with the
  standard `(N-Store)` diagnostic. Accept path (const / iter / guard / `?? d`) all run.

## The blocker that stopped the naive "flip + migrate 8 sites" (READ THIS)

Flipping `LOFT_INDEX_DEV` ON breaks **6 wrap tests**, and the reject-count measurement MISSED most
of them (see [[measure-flip-by-running-suite]] — measure by RUNNING the suite, not grepping rejects):

1. **SILENT copy-elision wrong-answer (the load-bearing fix, do FIRST).** `v[i]` typing `Item?`
   mis-classifies a MUTATED / ESCAPING element borrower (`e = v[i]; e.x = 99`) in the copy-elision
   analysis, so the copy-keep decision flips and the mutation LEAKS to the source. Repro:
   `tests/scripts/85-borrow-elision-element-borrower.loft` `mut_elem` returns the wrong value on
   BOTH backends (a wrong ANSWER, no compile error). This is the deps subsystem — loft's #1 weakness.
2. **loft-in-loft COMPILER ripple:** `dir` / `last` / `parser_debug` / `wasm_dir` — these run the
   compiler over other files, and `lib/parser.loft` + `lib/code.loft` use `v[i]` (~130 undefended
   reads; 0 direct rejects, but they ripple through these tests). Same class as the DN1 flip's F1a.
3. **`library_suite` (audience_crystal)** — a library `v[i]` / field-defense interaction.
4. **`loft_suite`** — the .loft corpus (85-borrow + the direct rejects below).

## The steps (each ends green; commit per step)

**Step 0 — reproduce + MEASURE by running (not grepping).** Flip the gate in fields.rs
(`std::env::var_os("LOFT_INDEX_DEV").is_some() && …` → `crate::keys::pln25_dn1_enabled() && …`),
build, then run and read FAILURES (asserts / panics / wrong values), both backends:
`cargo test --release --test wrap --test issues` and `LOFT_TIMEOUT=90 loft --native <corpus>`.
Then REVERT the gate flip and work under `LOFT_INDEX_DEV=1` per step. (Keep the gate dev-gated until
Step 6 so the tree stays green between commits.)

**Step 1 — ✅ DONE (copy-elision `Optional`-peel).** Fix = peel `.base()` before reading the
borrower's deps in `use_analysis` (the `borrowers` filter, `analyze_fn` ~504): `function.tp(e)
.base().depend().contains(&v)`. `Type::depend()` has no `Optional` arm (it recurses only through
`RefVar`/`Tuple`), and the index flip attaches the element's dep to the INNER type before the
`Optional` wrap (`parse_index` fields.rs 632-676 → `Optional(Reference(Item, [xs]))`), so without
the peel a nullable element borrower's dep was invisible → a mutated/escaping `e = v[i]` was missed,
the copy wrongly elided, and the mutation LEAKED to the source (SILENT wrong-answer).
- **Why detection-only is the whole fix (no re-point change needed):** the peel makes a mutated/
  escaping borrower `∈ ineligible` → the plan is REFUSED → copy kept (the fix). A read-only borrower
  is now detected + planned, but the re-point (`make_independent`/`depending`, also `Optional`-opaque)
  no-ops — which is BENIGN: `elide_rewrite` inlines the source into the borrower's def (`e = g.c[i]`),
  reads use that stored ref (not `e`'s dep), and the free pass already peels `Optional`. Proven on the
  boundary matrix (read-only elides+reads right / mutated keeps copy / escaping keeps copy) + a
  read-only stress set (late read, two borrowers, into-call), value+leak, BOTH backends, both gates.
- **Safe-by-construction for the default suite:** `.base()` is identity for non-`Optional` types;
  for an `Optional` borrower it can only ADD a detection, which only ever REFUSES a plan (keeps a
  copy — always correct) or adds a harmless read-only detection. It cannot introduce a wrong answer.
- **Regression:** `tests/scripts/25-index-elision-borrower.loft` (self-asserting; gate-OFF
  byte-identical) + `tests/pln25_dn1_consumption.rs::index_dev_elision_borrower_{interpret,native}`
  (runs it under `LOFT_INDEX_DEV=1`, both backends). NOT touched: `depend()`/`depending()`/`deps_ref()`
  globally (74/31/3 callers, DN1-default-live — wider than the failing region, no correctness gain).

<details><summary>Original Step-1 notes (starting points)</summary>

Make the element-borrower classification peel `Optional` so `e = v[i]` where `e: Item?` is still
recognized as borrowing `v`, and its mutation/escape is still detected (so a mutated/escaping
borrower KEEPS the copy). Starting points found this session:
- `src/use_analysis.rs` — `ElidePlan` (struct ~195; `borrowers` field ~202 "Vars that BORROW `v`
  (`e = v[i]` …)"; `visit` ~210; the re-point comment ~498). The plan is only emitted when "every
  borrower is read-only and non-escaping" — that read-only/escaping classification is what breaks
  when `e` is `Optional`-typed.
- `src/scopes.rs:301` — "A var that BORROWS `v` (`e = v[i]`, `deps` ∋ `v`)".
- **Method:** boundary matrix on the 85-borrow trio (read-only ELIDES + reads right; mutated KEEPS
  COPY + source unchanged; escaping KEEPS COPY) — value + leak, BOTH backends (the
  `engineering-rigor` + `loft-codegen` skills; the deps north-star is `OWNERSHIP_MODEL.md`). The
  fix is almost certainly a `.base()`/`peel_optional` at the point the classifier reads the
  borrower's type or matches the `e = v[i]` shape — but PROVE it on the matrix, don't guess (this
  is the deps system; symptom-patching it is how the heap model became loft's #1 weakness).

> **PROGRESS (2026-07-02) — the compiler mechanism + corpus are done; audience_crystal is the last grind.**
> Measured under `LOFT_INDEX_DEV=1` after Step 1: **wrap PASSES** (Step 1's copy-elision fix already
> resolved the dir/last/parser_debug/wasm_dir lib-compiler ripple — lib/parser.loft + lib/code.loft do
> NOT reject), so **Step 2 is effectively DONE**. Committed since:
> - **✅ Element-WRITE mechanism (`81641e7d`)** — `v[i] = h` (moros_map:115, p379) errored "Cannot assign
>   to attribute on OpGetVector" because `towards_set`'s copy_ref gate didn't peel the `Optional(Reference)`
>   read-marker. Fixed: peel `.base()` in the copy_ref decision (collections.rs:761). An element-write is
>   an lvalue SLOT, not a nullable read. Gate-OFF byte-identical; issues 748/0.
> - **✅ Step 4 direct read-rejects (`b46413d0`)** — issues p124×2 (`arr[idx] ?? 0.0`), p155 (`?? H {}`,
>   SEGV/undo aliasing preserved), p170 (`p170_bs[len-1] ?? P170Bag {}`), 85-borrow esc_elem (discharge
>   `xs[i] ?? Item {}`, keep `-> Item`). p379 fixed by the element-write mechanism, not a migration.
> - **⚠️ DEFERRED DEPS GAP** — a bare `-> Item?` escaping-BORROWER return (esc_elem's naive form) LEAKS
>   (the Optional-return × copy-elision interaction; a plain `-> S?` struct return is leak-clean, so it's
>   specific to an escaping vector-copy element). Avoided via the discharge migration; the underlying
>   free-path peel is a separate deps-subsystem fix.
> - **🟡 Step 3 audience_crystal (`cc7cb722`, PARTIAL)** — palettes + cell_h/cell_h_at + sort-swap
>   discharged; a few `-> integer` accessor sites remain (n_store_violation line attribution is
>   MIS-ATTRIBUTED to fn signatures — read the body by hand; the loop-var fit-proof is fine, verified).
>   Large index-heavy library; gate-OFF compiles clean, library_suite green.
> - **Step 5 (len-capture): NOT surfaced** — no site needed it (const / iter-var / `??` covered all).
> - **Step 6: NOT STARTED** — needs audience_crystal finished + a full under-flip corpus/library sweep first.

**Step 2 — lib compiler migration** — ✅ DONE (resolved by Step 1; wrap passes under the flip).

**Step 3 — audience_crystal library** — 🟡 PARTIAL (`cc7cb722`). Finish the remaining `-> integer`
accessor discharges (read bodies by hand past the mis-attributed line numbers), then measure the rest
of the corpus/libraries under `LOFT_INDEX_DEV=1` (only issues/wrap/85-borrow/audience_crystal measured).

**Step 4 — the direct N-Store rejects** — ✅ DONE (`b46413d0`): issues p124×2/p155/p170 + 85-borrow.
p379 resolved by the element-write mechanism fix (`81641e7d`).

**Step 5 — len-capture proof** — not needed (no site surfaced it).

**Step 6 — flip the gate + retire the warning + graduate.** Change the fields.rs gate
`LOFT_INDEX_DEV` → `pln25_dn1_enabled`; RETIRE the now-redundant `FaultKind::VectorIndex` /
`TextIndex` warning under DN1 in `emit_undefended_warning` (operators.rs — same as Div/Rem got in
`7042d94c`, since the TYPE is now the enforcement); graduate `tests/scripts/25-index-nullable.loft`
(accept: const / iter-var / then-guard / else-guard / `??` / honest `τ?`) + a reject twin in
`102-expected-errors.loft`. Full suite green both backends → done; update RESUME F1b + the
formal/types.md deviation.

## Also on the DN3 fault-op docket (separate slices, not part of F1a)

- **gap #3** — `??` discharges regardless of its fallback's nullability (`handle_null_coalesce`,
  operators.rs:1366 `*ctp = ctp.base()`); `x ?? null` unsoundly types non-null. Rule: result is `τ?`
  iff the fallback is nullable. Own blast radius (every `a ?? nullableVar`).
- **call-arg N-Store** — a nullable passed into a non-null CALL ARG is not checked (`takes(v[j])`
  doesn't reject). Affects division equally; closing it covers all fault-ops at once.
