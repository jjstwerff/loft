ownership_fuzz.py — @PLN85 fuzz-proof gate, first increment (the GENERATOR).

The cross-backend value/exit/leak ORACLE already exists (tests/differential_oracle.rs,
divergences()) and the leak signal is the same "stores not freed" string on both backends.
What was missing is a program-level GENERATOR feeding it over the ownership-composition axes.
This is that generator, scoped to the cheapest axis that exercises the store-lifetime class:
the CHURN / cardinality axis (loop + pressure counts), because the over-free class only
corrupts once a freed slot is REUSED (probes/over-free-sweep/README.md).

Two stages, per the perf split (native compiles via rustc — too slow for a tight loop):
  fast loop  : run each program on --interpret with leak detection  (catches interp crash + leak)
  replay     : re-run every FLAGGED program (+ a sample) on --native (cross-backend divergence + native leak)

Violation modes (the four the invariant can break into):
  CRASH       : a backend exits non-zero (139 = SIGSEGV → UAF/over-free)
  LEAK        : "stores not freed" on a backend's stderr
  DIVERGENCE  : interp stdout != native stdout, or success disagrees (silent two-owner corruption)
  WRONG       : a cell's OWN assertion failed — the answer is wrong even where the two
                backends agree about it (added 2026-08-18, loft#974: aligning the backends
                removed the disagreement that had been the only way this was visible)

Positive control (--self-test) — CONTROL PAIRS, re-pinned 2026-07-03 after the join_own
default-ON flip (and this week's ungated fixes) cleaned the P14 probe file on BOTH
configurations; re-pinned again 2026-07-04 when the #497 reassignment deep-copy closed
every crash cell even under LOFT_NO_JOIN_OWN=1 — the buggy config now disables BOTH
preservation gates (LOFT_NO_JOIN_OWN + LOFT_NO_REASSIGN_COPY).  The controls anchor on
GENERATED cells that still reproduce on the preserved raw path, one per detector channel:
  wrong/divergence : elem_accumulate__struct__heavy — gate-OFF the cell computes the wrong
                     answer; clean on the default gate.  It anchored the DIVERGENCE
                     spelling until 2026-08-18, when loft#974 made native stop masking the
                     corruption with a defensive copy: both backends then failed the same
                     assertion, the disagreement vanished, and the channel read CLEAN on a
                     cell that still reproduces.  The cell was right and the ORACLE was
                     short a channel — so `WRONG` was added rather than the control
                     re-pinned a third time;
  leak             : local_source__struct__none — both-backends LEAK gate-OFF,
                     clean on the default gate.
Each is a PAIR: (1) the buggy config must be FLAGGED (the detector can fire — not vacuous);
(2) the default gate must be CLEAN (pins the join_own fix; a flip regression fails here).
(engineering-rigor: prove the harness can fail — and that the fix it validated stays landed.)

Usage:
  ownership_fuzz.py --self-test                       # prove the harness can fail (P14)
  ownership_fuzz.py --corpus <dir>...                 # baseline: run every .loft through the oracle
