# Loft Language Design Inconsistencies

This document catalogues asymmetries, surprising behaviours, and design tensions in the
loft language. It focuses on things that *work* but feel inconsistent — bugs and crashes
belong in [PROBLEMS.md](PROBLEMS.md) instead.

Each entry notes **Severity**: High = silent wrong behaviour; Medium = surprising but safe;
Low = cosmetic or minor. Where a path to resolution is obvious it is included.

Fixed items have been removed from this file; their resolutions are in CHANGELOG.md.

## 2. Vector Has a Much Richer API Than Sorted / Index / Hash

**Severity: Medium** — partially resolved 2026-03-14 (loop attributes documented/implemented)

All four collection types use the same `+=` and `for` syntax.  The iteration toolkit is:

| Feature | `vector` | `sorted` | `index` | `hash` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `#first`, `#count` in loop | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | N/A (cannot iterate) |
| `#index` in loop | ✓ (0-based) | ✓ (0-based array pos) | ✗ compile error | N/A |
| `e#remove` in filtered loop | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | use `h[key] = null` |
| `rev()` reverse iteration | ✓ (via range) | ✓ | ✓ | N/A |
| Slicing `[a..b]` | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Comprehension `[for x in ...]` | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Filtered `for x in c if cond` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | N/A |

Remaining API gaps (slicing, comprehension) are structural and not planned.

## 8. Method vs. Free Function Is an Arbitrary Standard-Library Choice

**Severity: Low**

There is no language-level rule about what becomes a method vs. a free function; it
depends entirely on whether the standard library defines the first parameter as `self`.

```loft
length(v)           // free function — NOT v.length()
length(text)        // same free function name for both text and vector

text.starts_with(s) // method — defined as fn starts_with(self: text, ...)
text.find(s)        // method
abs(n)              // free function — NOT n.abs()
pow(b, e)           // free function
```

A user cannot predict whether an operation is a method or a free function without looking
it up. Some text operations are methods (`starts_with`, `find`, `trim`) while the most
basic one (`length`) is a free function. The language allows both forms equally; the
inconsistency is in the standard-library naming choices.

---

## 9. Text/Character Split: Indexing and Slicing Return Different Types

**Severity: Low**

```loft
txt = "hello"
txt[0]      // character — a single Unicode scalar value
txt[0..1]   // text — a one-character string

vec = [1, 2, 3]
vec[0]      // integer
vec[0..1]   // vector<integer> — consistent: element type vs. collection type
```

`txt[i]` and `txt[i..i+1]` are different types (`character` vs. `text`), making string
manipulation awkward: building a text from characters requires `"{c}"` interpolation, not
direct concatenation with `+`. The vector pattern (element vs. slice of same collection
type) would be cleaner.

---


## 17. Implicit Type Coercion Rules Are Not Uniform

**Severity: Low**

| Conversion | Form required |
|---|---|
| Any type → boolean (`if v`, `!v`, `assert`) | Implicit |
| Integer ↔ float in arithmetic | Implicit widening |
| Float → integer (truncate) | Explicit: `f as integer` |
| Text → integer/float | Explicit: `"5" as integer` |
| Integer → text | Implicit inside `"{v}"` only |
| Plain-enum name → enum | Explicit: `"West" as Direction` |
| Struct-enum variant → parent enum | Implicit on assignment |

There is no single rule. Boolean coercion is always implicit; most numeric conversions
require `as`; format-string interpolation converts silently. A user cannot predict from
first principles whether a given conversion is automatic or requires an explicit cast.

---

## 18. `#break` Reuses the `#attribute` Syntax for a Control-Flow Statement

**Severity: Low**

```loft
for x in 1..5 {
    for y in 1..5 {
        if cond { x#break; }   // breaks out of the x loop
    }
}
```

The `#` suffix notation is used for two completely different purposes:
- **Loop metadata** — `x#first`, `x#count`, `x#index`, `x#next`, `x#remove`: read or
  write properties that are expressions or assignment targets.
- **Loop control** — `x#break`: a statement that transfers control and has no value.

Making `x#attr` sometimes an expression and sometimes a jump instruction complicates the
mental model for the `#` notation.

---

## 26. Match Exhaustiveness Ignores Guarded Arms

**Severity: Medium**

```loft
match c {
    Red if some_cond => "red",     // does NOT count as covering Red
    Green => "green",
    Blue => "blue",
    _ => "fallback"                // still required even though Red has an arm
}
```

A guarded arm (`pattern if guard => body`) does not count as covering that variant for
exhaustiveness checking (`control.rs:642`). This is correct — the guard might fail at
runtime — but it means a programmer who writes guards on every variant still needs a
wildcard arm or will get a non-exhaustive error. The interaction between guards and
exhaustiveness is not obvious from the syntax.

**Status (2026-04-13):** Documented in
[LOFT.md § Pattern matching](LOFT.md) under the "Guard clauses"
paragraph with a worked example (Red-if-bright / Green-if-bright / Blue / `_`).
Three regression guards in `tests/issues.rs` lock the behaviour:
`inc26_guarded_arm_without_wildcard_is_rejected` (asserts the compile error
wording, including the `'_ =>' wildcard` fix-it hint),
`inc26_guarded_arm_with_wildcard_compiles` (compiles + runs when the wildcard
is present), and `inc26_guarded_arm_falls_through_when_guard_false` (runtime
fall-through to a subsequent unguarded arm).  The wildcard requirement is an
acknowledged soundness property, not a silent surprise.

---

## 27. `break` Keyword and `x#break` Attribute Are Two Mechanisms for the Same Action

**Severity: Medium**

```loft
break           // exits the innermost loop — keyword
x#break         // exits the loop whose variable is x — attribute expression
```

`break` and `continue` are reserved keywords that appear as statements. `x#break` uses
the `#attribute` syntax on a loop variable to jump out of a named loop. The two forms
look unrelated: a reader encountering `x#break` would guess it reads a property named
`break` from `x`, not that it is a control-flow jump.

There is also an asymmetry: `x#break` has no `x#continue` counterpart, so skipping the
remainder of a named outer loop requires code restructuring.

**Advice:** Consider replacing `x#break` and introducing `break x` / `continue x` as
labelled-break forms, consistent with how other languages handle named loop exits
(`break 'label` in Rust, `break label` in Java). The existing `#` notation could be
kept for read-only loop metadata (`#first`, `#count`, `#index`) and `#remove`, which
are genuine attribute reads.

---

## 28. Vector Slice Syntax Has No Grammar Entry and Diverges From Range Syntax

**Severity: Low**

```loft
v[start..end]   // slice — end exclusive (matches for-loop range)
v[start..]      // open end  (also valid in for-loop)
v[..end]        // open start — NO for-loop counterpart
v[2..-1]        // negative index — NO for-loop counterpart
v[1..=3]        // inclusive end — valid in for-loop and match; undocumented for slices
```

The grammar summary defines `range_expr` for `for` loops and `match` arms but does not
include the slice forms `[..end]` and `[n..-1]`. Users cannot tell from the grammar
whether `v[1..=3]` (inclusive slice) is supported.

**Advice:** Add a `slice_expr` production to the grammar summary that enumerates all
valid slice forms and documents which are shared with `range_expr`. Clarify whether
`..=` is supported in slices.

## Summary by Severity

### High (silent wrong behaviour)
_All fixed — see CHANGELOG.md._

### Medium (surprising but safe)
| # | Issue |
|---|---|
| 27 | `break` keyword and `x#break` attribute are two mechanisms for the same action; no `x#continue` |

### Low (cosmetic or minor)
| # | Issue |
|---|---|
| 2 | `#first`/`#index`/`#remove` availability varies by collection type |
| 8 | Method vs. free function assignment is arbitrary in the standard library |
| 9 | `txt[i]` is `character`; `txt[i..i+1]` is `text` — different types |
| 17 | Type coercion rules are not uniform (implicit / explicit / format-only) |
| 18 | `x#break` is a jump statement, reusing the `#attribute` expression syntax |
| 28 | Vector slice forms `[..end]` and `[n..-1]` absent from grammar; `..=` undocumented for slices |

### Resolved as design point (documented + regression-guarded)

These were inconsistencies whose semantics are now (a) explicitly documented in
LOFT.md as a "Gotcha" or asymmetry callout and (b) locked by regression tests
in `tests/issues.rs`.  They remain inconsistencies — but they're acknowledged
ones, not silent surprises.  Removed from the severity tables above.

| # | Issue | Doc + Tests |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | `#index` byte-offset on text vs. element-position on vector | LOFT.md § Loop attributes (Gotcha block); `inc3_*` regression tests |
| 12 | Sort direction declared on struct drives iteration direction of every query | LOFT.md § Collection types (Gotcha block); `inc12_sorted_ascending_*` / `inc12_sorted_descending_*` regression tests |
| 26 | Match exhaustiveness ignores guarded arms — wildcard still required | LOFT.md § Pattern matching (Guard clauses paragraph); `inc26_*` regression tests |
| 29 | `!b` on boolean catches false and null; `!n` on integer catches null only | LOFT.md null-sentinel table (`!value` asymmetry subsection); `inc29_*` regression tests |
| 30 | `{...}` double-duty (struct init vs. block) — claimed silent-typo case is not reproducible on current loft; the `{ x, y }` typo parses as a struct-init attempt and fails on the missing colon | `inc30_struct_init_with_colons_works`, `inc30_block_expression_returns_last_value`, `inc30_typo_comma_without_colon_is_rejected` |
| 31 | Open-ended range patterns (`10..`, `..10`) in match arms were silently broken (interpreter: never matches; native: rustc crash).  Parser now emits a compile-time diagnostic pointing at the two-sided form or a guard idiom | `inc31_two_sided_exclusive_range_matches`, `inc31_two_sided_inclusive_range_matches`, `inc31_open_end_range_is_rejected`, `inc31_open_start_range_is_rejected` |
